It has been designed mainly to support the course “Statistics &amp; Data Analysis”, held at the University of Osnabrück, as part of the BSc Cognitive Science program. It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. It relies on simulation to illustrate selected statistical concepts. It introduces key concepts of data analysis from a frequentist and a Bayesian tradition. THE BOOK IS CURRENTLY BEING THOROUGHLY REVISED. DURING THAT PERIOD NOT ALL MATERAL (ESPECIALLY LINKS, REFERENCES ETC) WILL BE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT. "],["general-introduction.html", "1 General Introduction", " 1 General Introduction This chapter lays out the learning goals of this book (Section 1.1) and describes how these goals are to be achieved (Section 1.2). Section 1.3 details which technical tools and methods are covered in the course, and which are not. There will be some information on the kinds of data sets we will use during the course in Section 1.4. Finally, Section 1.5 provides information about how to install the necessary tools for this course. "],["Chap-01-00-intro-learning-goals.html", "1.1 Learning goals", " 1.1 Learning goals At the end of this course students should: pick up any data set to explore in a hypothesis-driven manner have gained the competence to understand complex data sets, manipulate a data set, so as to plot aspects of it in ways that are useful for answering a given research question understand the general logic of statistical inference in frequentist and Bayesian approach be able to independently evaluate statistical analyses based on their adequacy for a given research question and data set be able to critically assess the adequacy of analyses commonly found in the literature Notice that this is, although a lot of hard work already, sill rather modest! It doesn’t actually say that we necessarily aim at the competence to do it or even to do it flawlessly! Our main goal is understanding, because that is the foundation of practical success and the foundation of an ability to learn more in the future. We do not teach tricks! We do not share recipes! "],["Chap-01-00-intro-course-structure.html", "1.2 Course structure", " 1.2 Course structure The course consists of four parts. After giving a more detailed overview of the course in this chapter, Part I introduces R, the main programming language that we will use. Part II covers what is often called descriptive statistics. It also gives us room to learn more about R when we massage data into shape, compute summary statistics, and plot different data types in different ways. Part III is the main theoretical part. It covers what is often called inferential statistics. Two aspects distinguish this course from the bulk of its cousins out there. First, we use a two-pronged approach, i.e., we are going to introduce both the frequentist and the Bayesian approach to statistical inference side by side. The motivation for this is that seeing the contrast between the two approaches will lead to a better understanding of both approaches. Second, we will use a computational approach, i.e., we foster an understanding of mathematical notions with computer simulations or other variants of helpful code. Part IV covers applications of what we have learned so far. It focuses on generalized linear models, a class of models that have become the new standard for analyses of experimental data in the social and psychological sciences. They are also very useful for data exploration in other domains (such as machine learning). There are also appendices with additional information: Further useful material (textbooks, manuals, etc.) is provided in Appendix ??. Appendix ?? covers the most important probability distributions used in this book. An excursion providing more information about the important Exponential Family of probability distributions and the Maximum Entropy Principle is given in Appendix ??. The data sets which reoccur throughout the book as “running examples” are succinctly summarized in Appendix ??. "],["Chap-01-00-intro-tools-methods.html", "1.3 Tools and topics covered (and not covered) in the course", " 1.3 Tools and topics covered (and not covered) in the course The main programming language used in this course is R (R Core Team 2018). We will make heavy use of the tidyverse package (Wickham 2017), which provides a unified set of functions and conventions that deviate (sometimes: substantially) from basic R. We will also be using the probabilistic programming language WebPPL (Goodman and Stuhlmüller 2014), but only “passively” in order to quickly obtain results from probabilistic calculations that we can experiment with directly in the browser. We will not learn to write WebPPL code from scratch. We will rely on the R package brms (Bürkner 2017) for running Bayesian generalized regression models, which itself relies on the probabilistic programming language Stan (Carpenter et al. 2017). We will, however, not learn about Stan in this course. Instead of Stan we will use the package greta (Golding 2019) to write our models and do inference with them. This is because, for current learning purposes, the language in which greta formulates its models is much closer to R and so, let’s hope, easier to learn. Section 1.5 gives information about how to install these, and other tools necessary for this course. The main topics that this course will cover are: data preparation: how to clean up, and massage a data set into an appropriate shape for plotting and analysis data visualization: how to select relevant aspects of data to visualize in informative and useful ways statistical models: what that is, and why it’s beneficial to think in terms of models, not tests statistical inference: what that is, and how it’s done in frequentist and Bayesian approaches hypothesis testing: how Frequentists and Bayesians test scientific hypotheses generalized regression: how to apply generalized regression models to different types of data sets There is, obviously, a lot that we will not cover in this course. We will, for instance, not dwell at any length on the specifics of algorithms for computing statistical inferences or model fits. We will also deal with the history and the philosophy of science of statistics only to the extent that it helps to understand the theoretical notions and practical habits that are important in the context of this course. We will also not do heavy math. Data analysis can be quite varied because data itself can be quite varied. We try to present some variation, but since this is an introductory course with lots of other ground to cover, we will be slightly conservative in the kind of data that we analyze. There will be, for example, no pictures, sounds, dates or time points in any of the material covered here. There are at least two different motivations for data analysis, and it is important to keep them apart. This course focuses on data analysis for explanation, i.e., routines that help us understand reality through the inspection and massaging of empirical data. We will only glance at the alternative approach, which is data analysis for prediction, i.e., using models to predict future observations, as commonly practiced in machine learning and its applications. In sloppy slogan form, this course treats data science for scientific knowledge gain, not as engineers’ applications. References "],["Chap-01-00-intro-data-sets.html", "1.4 Data sets covered", " 1.4 Data sets covered We want to learn how to do data analysis. This is impossible without laying hands on several data sets. But switching from one data set to another is mentally taxing. It is also difficult to focus and to really care about any old data set. This is why this course relies on a small selection of recurring data sets that are, hopefully, generally interesting for the target audience: students of cognitive science. Appendix ?? gives an overview of the most important, recurring data sets used in this course. Most of the data sets that we will use repeatedly in this class come from various psychological experiments. To make this even more emersive, these experiments are implemented as browser-based experiments, using _magpie. This makes it possible for students of this course to actually conduct the exact experiments whose data we will analyze (and maybe generate some more intuitions and some hypotheses). But it also makes it possible that we will analyze ourselves. That’s why part of the exercises for this course will run additional analyses on data collected from the aspiring data analysts themselves. If you want to become an analyst, you should also have undergone analysis yourself, so to speak. "],["Chap-01-00-intro-installation.html", "1.5 Installation", " 1.5 Installation This course relies on a few different pieces of software. Primarily, we’ll be using R, but we’ll need installations of Python and C++ in the background. There are two options for installing. The simplest method, described in Section 1.5.1 is to install VirtualBox and use our provided Ubuntu virtual machine (link provided in class), which has the required software pre-installed and tested. When using this method, you will be working in a virtualized Linux environment. Alternatively, you can go through a manual installation tailored to your own OS, as described in Section 1.5.2. Manual installation is recommended if you do not wish to use a virtualized Linux environment. The VirtualBox method can be a fall-back option if the manual installation fails. Finally, Section 1.5.3 explains how to update the R package that wraps all R packages needed for this course and provides some extra convenience functions. 1.5.1 VirtualBox Setup 1.5.1.1 Step 1. Install VirtualBox Follow the instructions here to download and install for your platform. 1.5.1.2 Step 2. Download our Ubuntu image Download the provided VirtualBox Disk Image and move it into a folder such as “VMs”. The link for the VirtualBox Disk Image is provided on StudIP. 1.5.1.3 Step 3. Create a new virtual machine and add the downloaded image Open VirtualBox and click New Give your new virtual machine a name, e.g. “IDA2019” Change the Machine Folder to the folder where you put the disk image (e.g. inside the folder “VMs”) Change the Type to “Linux” and Version to “Ubuntu (64-bit)” and click Next to proceed to memory allocation Allocate about half of your available memory and click Next to proceed to hard disk selection Choose “Use an existing virtual hard disk file” and use the file selection icon to add our provided disk image Click Create 1.5.1.4 Step 4. Give your virtual machine more processing power Select your virtual machine on the right panel and click Settings on the top Navigate to System -&gt; Processor Increase the Processor(s) to about half of what your computer can provide 1.5.1.5 Step 5. Boot your virtual machine Select your virtual machine and click Start The username of the system is “user” and the password is “password” 1.5.1.6 Step 6. Install further packages The virtual machine includes most of the packages required, but not all. First, run the following commands in ‘Terminal’: sudo apt update sudo apt install r-cran-devtools r-cran-boot r-cran-extradistr r-cran-ggsignif r-cran-naniar Then, open RStudio and run the following command in the R console: devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) 1.5.1.7 Troubleshooting If the virtual machine does not boot, you may need to ensure that ‘virtualization’ is enabled in your computer’s BIOS. Talk to a tutor if you’re having difficulties doing so. 1.5.2 Manual installation If you don’t want to use the virtual machine, or it doesn’t work for you, the following six steps describe how to get the main components installed manually. Depending on your operating system (e.g. macOS, Linux, Windows), you might need to follow slightly different instructions, which are specified below. Depending on the exact setup of your computer, the results may vary. The virtual machine has been tested with the required software, so if you can, we recommend using that. 1.5.2.1 Step 1. Install Python Windows and macOS: We recommend installing miniconda from here Linux: You can install miniconda or you can just use the preinstalled Python (which saves time and space). Make sure you have pip installed, e.g. for Ubuntu sudo apt install python3-pip 1.5.2.2 Step 2. Install the required Python packages We have provided files that list the required Python packages. They can be installed automatically with the following commands in the terminal. For Anaconda: Download this environment file, open a terminal, navigate to the folder which contains the downloaded file and run conda env create -f environment.yml For Linux users who are using pip: Download this requirements file pip3 install -r requirements.txt 1.5.2.3 Step 3. Install R Windows and macOS: Download and install R from here Linux users: We need to have at least version 3.5 of R. This may be available in your distribution’s repository. If you are using a recent version of Ubuntu (18.10 or later), you can install R with sudo apt install r-base. Otherwise, follow these instructions for your OS version. 1.5.2.4 Step 4. Install RStudio All platforms: Download and install the latest version of RStudio from here 1.5.2.5 Step 5. Install a C++ toolchains For the Stan language, which will be interfaced through an R package called brms, you’ll need a working C++ compiler. Windows: Download and install the latest version of RTools from here macOS: Download and install the latest version of RTools for macOS from here Note: you may need to register for an Apple Developer account (free of charge). Linux (e.g. Ubuntu): You can install a compiler and toolchain with sudo apt install build-essential. 1.5.2.6 Step 6. Install R packages We have created an R package that, when installed, will prompt the installation of the packages we will use in this course. In this step, you’ll install this package (and automatically install its dependencies). For Windows and macOS: Open RStudio and run the following two commands in the console. install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) For Linux (e.g. Ubuntu): It’s much faster (and less error-prone) if you install devtools from the app repository via terminal: apt install r-cran-devtools and continue to the second line in the R console. But this will only work if you are using a recent version of Ubuntu (18.10 or later). If you had to manually update your R to version in step 3, you’ll need to install the following from a terminal: apt install libssl-dev libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev and then install via the the R console: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) 1.5.3 Updating the course package Occasionally, we might have to add packages or functionality as we go through this course. In that case, you will have to update the package IDA2019-package that takes care of all updates. To update, use the following command in the R console: devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) "],["Chap-01-01-R.html", "2 Basics of R", " 2 Basics of R R is a specialized programming language for data science. Though old, it is heavily supported by an active community. New tools for data handling, visualization, and statistical analysis are provided in the form of packages.1 While other programming languages,like Python or Julia, specialized for scientific computing, also lend themselves beautifully for data analysis, the choice of R in this course is motivated because R’s raison d’être is data analysis. Also, some of the R packages used in this course provide cutting-edge methods that are not as conveniently available in other programming languages (yet).  In a manner of speaking, there are two flavors of R. We should distinguish base R from the tidyverse. Base R is what you have when you do not load any packages. We enter the tidyverse by loading the package tidyverse (see below for information on how to do that). The tidyverse consists of several components (which are actually stand-alone packages that can be loaded separately if needed) all of which supply extra functionality for data analysis, based on a unifying philosophy and representation format. While eventually interchangeable, the look-and-feel of base R and the tidyverse is quite different. Figure 2.1 lists a selection of packages from the tidyverse in relation to their role at different stages of the process of data analysis. The image is taken from this introduction to the tidyverse. Figure 2.1: Overview of selected packages from the tidyverse. The course will also introduce Rmarkdown in Section 2.6. Rmarkdown is a nice way of documenting your data analysis in a reproducible form. Participants will use Rmarkdown to prepare their homework assignments. Make sure to have completely installed everything of relevance for this course, as described in Section 1.5. Unless you have strong opinions or an unassailable favorite, we recommend trying RStudio as an IDE for R. The official documentation for base R is An Introduction to R. The standard reference for using the tidyverse is R for Data Science (R4DS). There are some very useful cheat sheets which you should definitely check out! There are pointers to further material in Appendix ??. The learning goals for this chapter are: become familiar with R, its syntax and basic notions become familiar with the key functionality of the tidyverse understand and write simple R scripts be able to write documents in Rmarkdown Packages live in the official package repository CRAN, or are supplied in less standardized forms, e.g., via open repositories, such as GitHub.↩ "],["ch1-first-steps.html", "2.1 First steps", " 2.1 First steps R is an interpreted language. This means that you do not have to compile it. You can just evaluate it line by line, in a so-called session. The session stores the current values of all variables. Usually, code is stored in a script, so one does not have to retype it when starting a new session.2 Try this out by either typing r to open an R session in a terminal or load RStudio.3 You can immediately calculate stuff: 6 * 7 ## [1] 42 Exercise E.1 Calculate in R concole (659-34)*5 2.1.1 Functions R has many built-in functions. The most common situation is that the function is called by its name using prefix notation, followed by round brackets that enclose the function’s arguments (separated by commata if multiple). For example, the function round takes a number and, per default, returns the closest integer: # the function `round` takes a number as an argument and # returns the closest integer (default) round(0.6) ## [1] 1 Actually, round allows several arguments. It takes as input the number x to be rounded and another integer number digits which gives the number of digits after the comma to which x should be rounded. We can then specify these arguments in a function call of round by providing the named arguments. # rounds the number `x` to the number `digits` of digits round(x = 0.138, digits = 2) ## [1] 0.14 if all of the parsed arguments are named, then their order does not matter. But all non-named arguments have to be presented in the positions expected by the function; to find out the right order one should use help, as explained below in 2.1.6) after subtracting the named arguments from the ordered list of arguments. round(x = 0.138, digits = 2) # works as intended round(digits = 2, x = 0.138) # works as intended round(0.138, digits = 2) # works as intended round(0.138, 2) # works as intended round(x = 0.138, 2) # works as intended round(digits = 2, 0.138) # works as intended round(2, x = 0.138) # works as intended round(2, 0.138) # does not work as intended (returns 2) Functions can have default values for some or for all of their arguments. In the case of round, the default is digits = 0. There is obviously no default for x in the function round. round(x = 6.138) # returns 6 ## [1] 6 Some functions can take an arbitrary number of arguments. The function sum, which sums up numbers is a point in case. # adds all of its arguments together sum(1,2,3) ## [1] 6 Selected functions can also be called in infix notation. This applies to frequently recurring operations, such as mathematical operations or logical comparisons. # both of these calls sum 1, 2, and 3 together sum(1,2,3) # prefix notation 1 + 2 + 3 # prefix notation Section 2.3 will list some of the most important built-in functions. It will also explain how to define your own functions. 2.1.2 Variables You can assign values to variables using three assignment operators: -&gt;, &lt;- and =, like so: x &lt;- 6 # assigns 6 to variable x 7 -&gt; y # assigns 7 to variable y z = 3 # assigns 3 to variable z x * y / z # returns 6 * 7 / 3 = 14 ## [1] 14 Use of = is discouraged.4 It is good practice to use a consistent naming scheme for variables. This book uses snake_case_variable_names and tends towards using long_and_excessively_informative_names for important variables, and short variable names, like i, j or x, for local variables, indices etc. 2.1.3 Literate coding It is good practice to document code with short but informative comments. Comments in R are demarcated with #. x &lt;- 4711 # a nice number from Cologne Since everything on a line after an occurrence of # is treated as a comment, it is possible to break long function calls across several lines, and to add comments to each line: round( # call the function `round` x = 0.138, # number to be rounded digits = 2 # number of after-comma digits to round to ) Exercise E.2 Create 2 variables and assign values 103 and 14 to them. Next, devide first one by the second and produce an output with 3 digits after comma. In RStudio, you can use Command+Shift+C (on Mac) and Ctrl+Shift+C (on Windows/Linux) to comment or uncomment code, and you can use comments to structure your scripts. Any comment followed by ---- is treated as a (foldable) section. # SECTION: variable assignments ---- x &lt;- 6 y &lt;- 7 # SECTION: some calculations ---- x * y 2.1.4 Objects Strictly speaking, all entities in R are objects but that is not always apparent or important for everyday practical purposes see the manual for more information. R supports an object-oriented programming style, but we will not make (explicit) use of this functionality. In fact, this course heavily uses and encourages a functional programming style (see Section 2.4). However, some functions (e.g., optimizers or fitting functions for statistical models) return objects, and we will use this output in various ways. For example, if we run some model on a data set the output is an object. Here, for example, we run a regression model, that will be discussed later on in the course, on a “cars” dataset. # you do not need to understand this code model_fit = lm(formula = speed~dist, data = cars) # just notice that the function `lm` returns an object is.object(model_fit) ## [1] TRUE # printing an object on the screen usually gives you summary information print(model_fit) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = speed ~ dist, data = cars) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) dist ## 8.2839 0.1656 2.1.5 Packages Much of R’s charm unfolds through the use of packages. CRAN has the official package repository. To install a new package from a CRAN mirror use the install.packages function. For example, to install the package devtools, you would use: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) Once installed, you need to load your desired packages for each fresh session, using: library(devtools) Once loaded, all functions, data, etc. that ship with a package are available without additional reference to the package name. If you want to be careful or courteous to an admirer of your code, you can reference the package a function that comes from explicitly. For example, the following code calls the function install_github from the package devtools explicitly (so that you would not need to load the package beforehand, for example):– devtools::install_github(&quot;SOME-URL&quot;) Indeed, the install_github function allows you to install bleeding-edge packages from Github. You can install all of the relevant packages using (after installing the devtools package, as described in Section 1.5: devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) After this installation, you can load all packages for this course simply by using: library(IDA2019) In RStudio, there is a special tab in the pane with information on “files”, “plots” etc. to show all installed packages. This also shows which packages are currently loaded. 2.1.6 Getting help If you encounter a function like lm that you do not know about, you can access its documentation with the help function or just typing ?lm. For example, the following call summons the documentation for lm, the first parts are shown in Figure 2.2. help(lm) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;visuals/R-doc-example.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Excerpt from the documentation of the lm function. If you are looking for help on a more general topic, use the function help.search. It takes a regular expression as input and outputs a list of occurrences in the available documentation. A useful shortcut for help.search is just to type ?? followed by the (unquoted) string to search for. For example, calling either of the following lines might produce a display like in Figure 2.3. # two equivalent ways for obtaining help on search term &#39;linear&#39; help.search(&quot;linear&quot;) ??linear knitr::include_graphics(&quot;visuals/R-doc-search-example.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Result of calling help.search for the term ‘linear’. The top entries in Figure 2.3 are vignettes. These are compact manuals or tutorial on particular topics or functions, and they are directly available in R. If you want to browse through the vignettes available on your machine (which depend on which packages you have installed), go ahead: browseVignettes() Line-by-line execution of code is useful for quick development and debugging. Make sure to learn about keyboard shortcuts to execute single lines or chunks of code in your favorite editor, e.g., check the RStudio Cheat Sheet for information on its keyboard shortcuts.↩ When starting a session in a terminal, you can exit a running R session by typing quit() or q().↩ You can produce &lt;- in RStudio with Option-- (on Mac) and Alt-- (on Windows/Linux). For other useful keyboard shortcuts, see here.↩ "],["ch1-data-types.html", "2.2 Data types", " 2.2 Data types Let’s briefly go through the data types that are most important for our later purposes. We can assess the type of an object stored in variable x with the function typeof(x). typeof(3) # returns type &quot;double&quot; typeof(TRUE) # returns type &quot;logical&quot; typeof(cars) # returns &#39;list&#39; (includes data.frames, tibbles, objects, ...) typeof(&quot;huhu&quot;) # return &#39;character&quot; (= string) typeof(mean) # return &#39;closure&quot; (= function) typeof(c) # return &#39;builtin&quot; (= deep system internal stuff) typeof(round) # returns type &quot;special&quot; (= well, special stuff?) To learn more about an object, it can help to just print it out as a string: str(lm) ## function (formula, data, subset, weights, na.action, method = &quot;qr&quot;, model = TRUE, ## x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE, singular.ok = TRUE, contrasts = NULL, ## offset, ...) It is sometimes possible to cast objects of one type into another type XXX using functions as.XXX in base R or as_XXX in the tidyverse. # casting Boolean value `TRUE` into number format as.numeric(TRUE) # returns 1 ## [1] 1 R is essentially an array-based language. Arrays are arbitrary but finite-dimensional matrices. We will discuss what is usually referred to as vectors (= one-dimensional arrays), matrices (= two-dimensional arrays), and arrays (= more-than-two-dimensional) in the following section on numeric information. But it is important to keep in mind that arrays can contain objects of other types than numeric information (as long as all objects in the array are of the same type). 2.2.1 Numeric vectors &amp; matrices 2.2.1.1 Numeric information Standard number format in R is double. typeof(3) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; We can also represent numbers as integers and complex. typeof(as.integer(3)) # returns &#39;integer&#39; ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; typeof(as.complex(3)) # returns &#39;complex&#39; ## [1] &quot;complex&quot; 2.2.1.2 Numeric vectors As a generally useful heuristic, expect every numerical information to be treated as a vector (or higher-order: matrix, array, … ; see below), and to expect any (basic, mathematical) operation in R to (most likely) apply to the whole vector, matrix, array, collection.5 This makes it possible to ask for the length of a variable to which we assign a single number, for instance: x &lt;- 7 length(x) ## [1] 1 We can even index such a variable: x &lt;- 7 x[1] # what is the entry in position 1 of the vector x? ## [1] 7 Or assign a new value to a hitherto unused index: x[3] &lt;- 6 # assign the value 6 to the 3rd entry of vector x x # notice that the 2nd entry is undefined, or &quot;NA&quot;, not available ## [1] 7 NA 6 Vectors in general can be declared with the built-in function c(). To memorize this, think of concatenation or combination. x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # this is now a 4-place vector x ## [1] 4 7 1 1 There are also helpful functions to generate sequences of numbers: 1:10 # returns 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1) # returns 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.5) # returns 1, 1.5, 2, ..., 9.5, 10 seq(from = 0, to = 1 , length.out = 11) # returns 0, 0.1, ..., 0.9, 1 Indexing in R starts with 1, not 0! x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # this is now a 4-place vector x[2] ## [1] 7 And now we see what is meant above when we said that (almost) every mathematical operation can be expected to apply to a vector: x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # 4-placed vector as before x + 1 ## [1] 5 8 2 2 Exercise E.3 Create a vector wich contaions all even numbers drom 0 to 20 and assign it to a variable. Now transform the variable such that it contains only odd numbers up to 20 using mathematical operation. Notice that the numbers avove 20 should not be included! HINT: you may use indexing to fullfill this creteria. 2.2.1.3 Numeric matrices Matrices are declared with the function matrix. This function takes, for instance, a vector as an argument. x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # 4-placed vector as before (m &lt;- matrix(x)) # cast x into matrix format ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 7 ## [3,] 1 ## [4,] 1 Notice that the result is a matrix with a single column. This is important. R uses so-called column-major mode.6 This means that it will fill columns first. For example, a matrix with three columns based on a six-placed vector \\(1, 2, \\dots, 6\\) will be built by filling the first column from top to bottom, then the second column top to bottom, and so on.7 m &lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3) m ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 In line with a column-major mode, vectors are treated as column vectors in matrix operations: x = c(1,0,1) # 3-place vector m %*% x # dot product with previous matrix &#39;m&#39; ## [,1] ## [1,] 6 ## [2,] 8 As usual, and independently of a column- or row-major mode, matrix indexing starts with the row index: m[1,] # produces first row of matrix &#39;m&#39; ## [1] 1 3 5 Exercise E.4 Create a matrix with three columns and three rows, wich contains random integers from 1 to 100 without replacement. HINT! You may first produce an array with random integers and then parse it to the matrix() function 2.2.1.4 Arrays Arrays are simply higher-dimensional matrices. We will not make use of arrays in this course. 2.2.1.5 Names for vectors, matrices and arrays The positions in a vector can be given names. This is extremely useful for good “literate coding” and therefore highly recommended. The names of vector x’s positions are retrieved and set by the names function: students &lt;- c(&quot;Jax&quot;, &quot;Jamie&quot;, &quot;Jason&quot;) # names of students grades &lt;- c(1.3, 2.7, 2.0) # a vector of grades names(grades) # retrieve names: with no nanmes so far ## NULL names(grades) &lt;- students # assign names names(grades) # retrieve names again: names assigned ## [1] &quot;Jax&quot; &quot;Jamie&quot; &quot;Jason&quot; grades # output shows names ## Jax Jamie Jason ## 1.3 2.7 2.0 We can also set the names of a vector directly during construction:8 # names of students (this is a character vector, see below) students &lt;- c(&quot;Jax&quot;, &quot;Jamie&quot;, &quot;Jason&quot;) # constructing a vector with names directly assigned grades &lt;- c(1.3, 2.7, 2.0, names = students) Names for matrices are retrieved or set with functions rownames and colnames. # declare matrix m &lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3) # assign row and column names, using function # `str_c` which is described below rownames(m) &lt;- str_c(&quot;row&quot;, 1:nrow(m), sep = &quot;_&quot;) colnames(m) &lt;- str_c(&quot;col&quot;, 1:ncol(m), sep = &quot;_&quot;) m ## col_1 col_2 col_3 ## row_1 1 3 5 ## row_2 2 4 6 2.2.2 Booleans There are built-in names for Boolean values “true” and “false”, predictably named TRUE and FALSE. Equivalent shortcuts are T and F. If we attempt to do math with Boolean vectors, the outcome is what any reasonable logician would expect: x &lt;- c(T,F,T) 1 - x ## [1] 0 1 0 x + 3 ## [1] 4 3 4 Boolean vectors can be used as index sets to extract elements from other vectors. # vector 1, 2, ..., 5 number_vector &lt;- 1:5 # index of odd numbers set to `TRUE` boolean_vector &lt;- c(T,F,T,F,T) # returns the elemnts from number vector, for which # the corresponding element in the Boolean vector is true number_vector[boolean_vector] ## [1] 1 3 5 2.2.3 Special values There are a couple of keywords reserved in R for special kinds of objects: NA: “not available”; represent missing values in data NaN: “not a number”; e.g., division zero by zero Inf or -Inf: infinity and negative infinity; returned when a number is too big or divided by zero NULL: the NULL object; often returned when a function is undefined for the provided input 2.2.4 Characters (= strings) Strings are called characters in R. We will be stubborn and call them strings for most of the time here. We can assign a string value to a variable by putting the string in double-quotes: x &lt;- &quot;huhu&quot; typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; We can create vectors of characters in the obvious way: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) chr_vector ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;hello&quot; &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; The package stringr from the tidyverse also provides very useful and, in comparison to base R, more uniform functions for string manipulation. The cheat sheet for the stingr package is highly recommended for a quick overview. Below are some examples. Function str_c concatenates strings: str_c(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;Hey&quot;, sep = &quot;! &quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello! Hi! Hey&quot; We can find the indices of matches in a character vector with str_which: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_which(chr_vector, &quot;hu&quot;) ## [1] 1 3 Similarly, str_detect gives a Boolean vector of matching: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_detect(chr_vector, &quot;hu&quot;) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE If we want to get the strings matching a pattern, we can use str_subset: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_subset(chr_vector, &quot;hu&quot;) ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;huhu&quot; Replacing all matches with another string works with str_replace_all: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_replace_all(chr_vector, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ## [1] &quot;BuBu&quot; &quot;Bello&quot; &quot;BuBu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; For data preparation, we often need to split strings by a particular character. For instance, a set of reaction times could be separated by a character line “|”. We can split this string representation to get individual measurements like so: # three measures of reaction time in a single string reaction_times &lt;- &quot;123|234|345&quot; # notice that we need to doubly (!) escape character | # notice also that the results is a list (see below) str_split(reaction_times, &quot;\\\\|&quot;, n = 3) ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;123&quot; &quot;234&quot; &quot;345&quot; 2.2.5 Factors Factors are special vectors, which treat its elements as ordered or unordered categories. This is useful for representing data from experiments, e.g., of categorical or ordinal variables (see Chapter 3). To create a factor, we can use the function factor. The following code creates an unorderd factor: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) factor(chr_vector) ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao ## Levels: ciao hello huhu Ordered factors also register the order of the categories: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) factor( chr_vector, # the vector to treat as factor ordered = T, # make sure its treated as ordered factor levels = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;) # specify order of levels ) ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao ## Levels: huhu &lt; ciao &lt; hello We will see that ordered factors are important, for example, in plotting when they determine the order in which different parts of data are arranged on the screen. They are also important for statistical analysis because they help determine how categories are compared to one another. Factors are trickier to work with than mere lists because they are rigid about the represented factor levels. Adding an item that does not belong to any of a factor’s levels, leads to trouble: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) my_factor &lt;- factor( chr_vector, # the vector to treat as factor ordered = T, # make sure its treated as ordered factor levels = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;) # specify order of levels ) my_factor[5] &lt;- &quot;huhu&quot; # adding a &quot;known category&quot; is okay my_factor[6] &lt;- &quot;moin&quot; # adding an &quot;unknown category&quot; does not work my_factor ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao huhu &lt;NA&gt; ## Levels: huhu &lt; ciao &lt; hello The forcats package from the tidyverse helps in dealing with factors. You should check the Cheat Sheet for more helpful functionality. Here is an example of how to expand the levels of a factor: chr_vector &lt;- c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) my_factor &lt;- factor( chr_vector, # the vector to treat as factor ordered = T, # make sure its treated as ordered factor levels = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;) # specify order of levels ) my_factor[5] &lt;- &quot;huhu&quot; # adding a &quot;known category&quot; is okay my_factor &lt;- fct_expand(my_factor, &quot;moin&quot;) # add new category my_factor[6] &lt;- &quot;moin&quot; # adding new item now works my_factor ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao huhu moin ## Levels: huhu &lt; ciao &lt; hello &lt; moin It is sometimes useful (especially for plotting) to flexibly reorder the levels of an ordered factor. Here are some useful functions from the forcats package: my_factor # original factor ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao huhu moin ## Levels: huhu &lt; ciao &lt; hello &lt; moin fct_rev(my_factor) # reverse level order ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao huhu moin ## Levels: moin &lt; hello &lt; ciao &lt; huhu fct_relevel( # manually supply new level order my_factor, c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;) ) ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao huhu moin ## Levels: hello &lt; ciao &lt; huhu &lt; moin 2.2.6 Lists, data frames &amp; tibbles Lists are key-value pairs. They are created with the built-in function list. The difference between a list and a named vector is that in the latter all elements must be of the same type. In a list, the elements can be of arbitrary type. They can also be vectors or even lists themselves. For example: my_list &lt;- list( single_number = 42, chr_vector = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;), nested_list = list(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3) ) my_list ## $single_number ## [1] 42 ## ## $chr_vector ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; ## ## $nested_list ## $nested_list$x ## [1] 1 ## ## $nested_list$y ## [1] 2 ## ## $nested_list$z ## [1] 3 To access a list element by its name (=key), we can use the $ sign followed by the unquoted name, double square brackets [[ &quot;name&quot; ]] with the quoted name inside, or indices in double brackets, like so: # all of these return the same list element my_list$chr_vector ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; my_list[[&quot;chr_vector&quot;]] ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; my_list[[2]] ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; Lists are very important in R because almost all structured data that belongs together is stored as lists. Objects are special kinds of lists. Data is stored in special kinds of lists, so-called data frames or so-called tibbles. A data frame is base R’s standard format to store data in. A data frame is a list of vectors of equal length. Data sets are instantiated with the function data.frame: # fake experimental data exp_data &lt;- data.frame( trial = 1:5, condition = factor( c(&quot;C1&quot;, &quot;C2&quot;, &quot;C1&quot;, &quot;C3&quot;, &quot;C2&quot;), ordered = T ), response = c(121, 133, 119, 102, 156) ) exp_data ## trial condition response ## 1 1 C1 121 ## 2 2 C2 133 ## 3 3 C1 119 ## 4 4 C3 102 ## 5 5 C2 156 Exercise E.5 Ex. Create a vector “a” wich contains names of 3 your best friends and a vector “b” with their age. Create a data frame, wich represents this information (One column with names ant one with respective age). Notice that column names should represent the information they contain! We can access columns of a data frame, just like we access elements in a list. Additionally, we can also use index notation, like in a matrix: # gives the value of the cell in row 2, column 3 exp_data[2,3] # return 133 ## [1] 133 Exercise E.6 Print out only names of friends from best_friends data frame. Exercise E.7 And now print out only friends’ names who are younger then 22. In RStudio, you can inspect data in data frames (and tibbles (see below)) with the function View. Tibbles are the tidyverse counterpart of data frames. We can cast a data frame into a tibble, using as_tibble. as_tibble(exp_data) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## trial condition response ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 C1 121 ## 2 2 C2 133 ## 3 3 C1 119 ## 4 4 C3 102 ## 5 5 C2 156 But we can also create a tibble directly with the keyword tibble. Indeed, the creation of tibbles is conveniently more flexible than the creation of data frames: the former allows dynamic look-up of previously defined elements. my_tibble &lt;- tibble(x = 1:10, y = x^2) # dynamic construction possible my_dataframe &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = x^2) # ERROR :/ Another important difference between data frames and tibbles concerns the default treatment of character (=string) vectors. When reading in data from a CSV file as a data frame (using function read.csv) each character vector is treated as a factor per default. But when using read_csv to read CSV data into a tibble character vector are not treated as factors. Exercise E.8 Create a vector “a” wich contains names of 3 your best friends and a vector “b” with their age. Create a tibble with two colums: name, age. Print it. Now, add a new column named “birht date” and the respective values. Add another column, which states TRUE,if the date of birth is even. (HINT: you can create a new column dynamicly! First you have to declare a column on the left sight (tibble[“name-of-the-column”]) , and then assign a value to it. For the latter you might check out modulo operator (%%). If you are familiar with Python’s scipy and numpy packages, this is R’s default mode of treating numerical information.↩ Python, on the other hand, uses the reverse row-major mode.↩ It is in this sense that the “first index moves fastest” in column-major mode, which is another frequently given explanation of column-major mode.↩ Notice that we can create strings (actually called ‘characters’ in R) with double quotes↩ "],["Chap-01-01-functions.html", "2.3 Functions", " 2.3 Functions 2.3.1 Some important built-in functions Many helpful functions are defined in base R or supplied by packages. We recommend browsing the Cheat Sheets every now and then to pick up more useful stuff for your inventory. Here are some functions that are very basic and generally useful. 2.3.1.1 Standard logic &amp;: “and” |: “or” !: “not” negate(): a pipe-friendly ! (see Section 2.5 for more on piping) all(): returns true of a vector if all elements are T any(): returns true of a vector if at least on element is T 2.3.1.2 Comparisons &lt;: smaller &gt;: greater ==: equal (you can also use near()instead of == e.g. near(3/3,1)returns TRUE) &gt;=: greater or equal &lt;=: less or equal !=: not equal 2.3.1.3 Set theory %in%: wheter an element is in a vector union(x,y): union of x and y intersect(x,y): intersection of x and y setdiff(x,y): all elements in x that are not in y 2.3.1.4 Sampling and combinatorics runif(): random number from unit interval [0;1] sample(x, size, replace): take size samples from x (with replacement if replace is T) choose(n,k): number of subsets of size n out of a set of size k (binomial coefficient) 2.3.2 Defining your own functions If you find yourself in a situation in which you would like to copy-paste some code, possibly with minor amendments, this usually means that you should wrap some recurring operations into a custom-defined function.   There are two ways of defining your own functions: as a named function, or an anonymous function. 2.3.2.1 Named functions The special operator supplied by base R to create new functions is the keyword function. Here is an example of defining a new function with two input variables x and y that returns a computation based on these numbers. We assign a newly created function to the variable cool_function so that we can use this name to call the function later. Notice that the use of the return keyword is optional here. If it is left out, the evaluation of the last line is returned. # define a new function # takes two numbers x &amp; y as argument # return x * y + 1 cool_function &lt;- function(x, y) {   return(x * y + 1)   } # apply `cool_function` to some numbers: cool_function(3,3)     # return 10 cool_function(1,1)     # return 2 cool_function(1:2,1)   # returns vector [2,3] cool_function(1)       # throws error: &#39;argument &quot;y&quot; is missing, with no default&#39; cool_function()        # throws error: &#39;argument &quot;x&quot; is missing, with no default&#39; We can give default values for the parameters passed to a function: # same function as before but with # default values for each argument cool_function_2 &lt;- function(x = 2, y = 3) {   return(x * y + 1) } # apply `cool_function_2` to some numbers: cool_function_2(3,3)     # return 10 cool_function_2(1,1)     # return 2 cool_function_2(1:2,1)   # returns vector [2,3] cool_function_2(1)       # returns 4 (= 1 * 3 + 1) cool_function_2()        # returns 7 (= 2 * 3 + 1) Exercise E.9 Create a function, which takes two numbers and outputs 0 if their product is less than 100, and 1 otherwise. 2.3.2.2 Anonymous functions Notice that we can feed functions as parameters to other functions. This is an important ingredient of a functional-style of programming, and something that we will rely on heavily in this course (see Section 2.4). When supplying a function as an argument to another function, we might not want to name the function that is passed. Here’s a (stupid, but hopefully illustrating) example: # define a function that takes a function as an argument new_applier_function &lt;- function(input, function_to_apply) {   return(function_to_apply(input)) } # sum vector with built-in &amp; named function new_applier_function(   input = 1:2,              # input vector   function_to_apply = sum   # built-in &amp; named function to apply )   # returns 3 # sum vector with anonymous function new_applier_function(   input = 1:2,              # input vector   function_to_apply = function(input) {     return(input[1] + input[2])   } )   # returns 3 as well Exercise E.10 How many variables should you parse to a function if: it tells if a sum of two numbers even? it applies 2 different operations to a variable and sums the results. Operations are not fixed in the function. "],["ch-01-01-loops-and-maps.html", "2.4 Loops and maps", " 2.4 Loops and maps For iteratively performing computation steps, R has a special syntax for for loops. Here is an example of an (again, stupid, but illustrative) example of a for loop in R: # fix a vector to transform input_vector &lt;- 1:6 # create output vector for memory allocation output_vector &lt;- integer(length(input_vector)) # iterate over length of input for (i in 1:length(input_vector)) { # multiply by 10 if even if (input_vector[i] %% 2 == 0) { output_vector[i] &lt;- input_vector[i] * 10 } else { output_vector[i] &lt;- input_vector[i] } } output_vector ## [1] 1 20 3 40 5 60 Exercise E.11 Let’s practice for-loops and if/else statments! Create a vector A with 10 random integers in range (1:50) and the other. Then, using for-loop make the second, filled with the mean of the corresponding intenger in vector A, one integer above it, and one after (For first and last intenger missing values are equal to 0). Print out the result as a tibble. R also provides functional iterators (e.g., apply), but we will use the functional iterators from the purrr package. The main functional operator from purrr is map which takes a vector and a function, applies the function to each element in the vector and returns a list with the outcome. There are also versions of map, written as map_dbl (double), map_lgl (logical) or map_df (data frame), which return a vector of doubles, Booleans or a data frame. Here is a first example of how this code looks in a functional style using the functional iterator map_dbl: map_dbl( input_vector, function(i) { if (input_vector[i] %% 2 == 0) { return(input_vector[i] * 10) } else { return (input_vector[i]) } } ) ## [1] 1 20 3 40 5 60 We can write this even shorter, using purrr’s short-hand notation for functions: map_dbl( input_vector, ~ ifelse( .x %% 2 == 0, .x * 10, .x) ) ## [1] 1 20 3 40 5 60 The trailing ~ indicates that we define an anonymous function. It, therefore, replaces the usual function(...) call which indicates which arguments the anonymous function expects. To make up for this, after the ~ we can use .x for the first (and only) argument of our anonymous function. To apply a function to more than one input vector, element per element, we can use pmap and its derivatives, like pmap_dbl etc. pmap takes a list of vectors and a function. In short-hand notation, we can define an anonymous function with ~ and integers like ..1, ..2 etc, for the first, second … argument. For example: x &lt;- 1:3 y &lt;- 4:6 z &lt;- 7:9 pmap_dbl( list(x, y, z), ~ ..1 - ..2 + ..3 ) ## [1] 4 5 6 "],["Chap-01-01-piping.html", "2.5 Piping", " 2.5 Piping When we use a functional style of programming, piping is your best friend. Consider the standard example of applying functions in what linguists would call “center-embedding”. We start with the input (written inside the inner-most bracketing), then apply the first function round, then the second mean, writing each next function call “around” the previous. # define input input_vector &lt;- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) # first round, then take mean mean(round(input_vector)) ## [1] 0.3333333 Things quickly get out of hand when more commands are nested. A common practice is to store intermediate results of computations in new variables which are only used to pass the result into the next step. # define input input_vector &lt;- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) # rounded input rounded_input &lt;- round(input_vector) # mean of rounded input mean(rounded_input) ## [1] 0.3333333 Piping lets you pass the result of a previous function call into the next. The magrittr package supplies a special infix operator %&gt;% for piping.9 The pipe %&gt;% essentially takes what results from evaluating the expression on its left-hand side and inputs it as the first argument in the function on its right-hand side. So x %&gt;% f is equivalent to f(x). Or, to continue the example from above, we can now write: input_vector %&gt;% round %&gt;% mean ## [1] 0.3333333 The functions defined as part of the tidyverse are all constructed in such a way that the first argument is the most likely input you would like to pipe into them. But if you want to pipe the left-hand side into another argument slot than the first, you can do that by using the . notation to mark the slot where the left-hand side should be piped into: y %&gt;% f(x, .) is equivalent to f(x,y). The pipe symbol %&gt;% can be inserted in RStudio with Ctrl+Shift+M (Win/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+M (Mac).↩ "],["ch-01-01-Rmarkdown.html", "2.6 Rmarkdown", " 2.6 Rmarkdown Homework assignments will be issued, filled, and submitted in Rmarkdown.

"],["Chap-02-01-data.html", "3 Data, variables &amp; experimental designs", " 3 Data, variables &amp; experimental designs The focus of this course is on data from behavioral psychology experiments.10 In a sense, this is perhaps the most “well-behaved” data to analyze and therefore an excellent starting point into data analysis. However, we should not lose sight of the rich and diverse guises of data that are relevant for scientific purposes. The current chapter therefore starts, in Section 3.1, with sketching some of that richness and diversity. But it then hones in on some basic distinctions of the kinds of data we will frequently deal with in the cognitive sciences in Section 3.2. We also pick up a few relevant concepts from a standard experimental design in Section 3.3. The learning goals for this chapter are: appreciate the diversity of data distinguish different kinds of variables dependent vs. independent nominal vs. ordinal vs. metric get familiar with basic aspects of experimental design factorial designs within- vs. between-subjects design repeated measures randomization, fillers and controls sample size A behavioral experiment is an experiment that records participants’ behavioral choices, such as button clicks or linguistic responses in the form of text or speech. This contrasts with, say, neurological experiments in which participants’ brain activity is recorded, such as with fMRI or EEG, or, e.g., in a psycholinguistic context, processing-related experiments in which secondary measures of cognitive activity are measured, such as eye-movements, pupil dilation or galvanic skin responses.↩ "],["Chap-02-01-data-kinds-of-data.html", "3.1 Different kinds of data", " 3.1 Different kinds of data Some say we live in the data age. But what is data actually? Purist pedants say: “The plural of datum” and add that a datum is just an observation. But when we say “data”, we usually mean a bit more than a bunch of observations. The Merriam-Webster offers the following definition: Factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. This is a teleological definition in the sense that it refers to the purpose of the thing: “used as basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation”. So, what we mean by “data” is, in large part, defined by what we intend to do with it. Another important aspect of this definition is that we usually consider data to be systematically structured in some way or another. Even when we speak of “raw data”, we expect there to be some structure (maybe labels, categories etc.) that distinguishes data from uninterpretable noise (e.g., the notion of a “variable”, discussed in Section 3.2). In sum, we can say that data is a representation of information stored in a systematic way for the purpose of inference, argument or decision making. There are different kinds of data. Figure 3.1 shows some basic distinctions, represented in a conceptual hierarchy. Figure 3.1: Hierarchy of different kinds of data relevant for ‘data science’. It is easy but wrong to think that data always has to be information based on observations of the world. It is easy to think this because empirical data, i.e., data obtained from empirical observation, is the most common form of data (given that it is, arguably, most relevant for decision making and argument). But it is wrong to think this because we can just as well look at virtual data. For example, virtual data, which is of interest to a data analyst, could be data obtained from computer simulation studies, e.g., from, say, one billion runs of a multi-agent simulation intended to shed light on the nature of cooperative interaction. It makes sense to analyze such data with the same tools as data from an experiment. For instance, we might find out that some parameter constellations in the simulation run are (statistically) most conducive to producing cooperative behavior among our agents. Another example of virtual data is data generated as predictions of a model, which we can use to test whether that model is any good, in so-called model criticism.11 Finally, we should also include logically possible sample data in this list, because of its importance to central ideas of statistical inference (especially \\(p\\)-values, see Section ??). Logically possible sample data are those that were neither observed nor predicted by a model, but something that could have been observed hypothetically, something that it is merely logically possible to observe, even if it would almost never happen in reality or would not be predicted by any serious model. The most frequent form of data, empirical data about the actual world, comes in two major variants. Observational data is data gathered by (passively) observing and recording what would have happened even if we had not been interested in it, so to speak. Examples of observational data are collections of socio-economic variables, like gender, education, income, number of children, etc. In contrast, experimental data is data recorded in a strict regime of manipulation-and-observation, i.e., a scientific experiment. Some pieces of information can only be recorded in an observational study (annual income), and others can only be obtained through experimentation (memory span). Both methods of data acquisition have their own pros and cons. Here are some of the more salient ones: Table 3.1: Comparison of the pros and cons of observational data and experimental data. observational experimental ecologically valid possibly artificial easy/easier to obtain hard/harder to obtain correlation &amp; causation hard to tease apart may yield information on causation vs. correlation No matter what kind of data we have at hand, there are at least two prominent purposes for which data can be useful: explanation and prediction. Though related, it is useful to keep these purposes cleanly apart. Data analysis for explanation uses the data to better understand the source of the data (the world, a computer simulation, a model, etc.). Data analysis for prediction tries to extract regularities from the data gathered so far to make predictions (as accurately as possible) about future or hitherto unobserved data. We will later speak of prior/posterior predictions for this kind of data. Other applicable terms are repeat data or sometimes fake data.↩ "],["Chap-02-01-data-variables.html", "3.2 On the notion of “variables”", " 3.2 On the notion of “variables” Data used for data analysis, even if it is “raw data”, i.e., data before preprocessing and cleaning, is usually structured or labeled in some way or other. Even if the whole data we have is a vector of numbers, we would usually know what these numbers represent. For instance, we might just have a quintuple of numbers, but we would (usually/ideally) know that these represent the results of an IQ test. # a simple data vector of IQ-scores IQ_scores &lt;- c(102, 115, 97, 126, 87) Or we might have a Boolean vector with the information of whether each of five students passed an exam. But even then we would (usually/ideally) know the association between names and test results, as in a table like this: # who passed the exam exam_results &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~pass, &quot;Jax&quot;, TRUE, &quot;Jason&quot;, FALSE, &quot;Jamie&quot;, TRUE ) Association of information, as between different columns in a table like the one above, is crucial. Most often, we have more than one kind of observation that we care about. Most often, we care about systematic relationships between different observables in the world. For instance, we might want to look at pass/fail results from an exam in co-occurrence with information about the proportion of attendance of the course’s tutorial sessions: # proportion of tutorials attended and exam pass/fail exam_results &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~tutorial_proportion, ~pass, &quot;Jax&quot;, 0.0, TRUE, &quot;Jason&quot;, 0.78, FALSE, &quot;Jamie&quot;, 0.39, TRUE ) exam_results ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## student tutorial_proportion pass ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 Jax 0 TRUE ## 2 Jason 0.78 FALSE ## 3 Jamie 0.39 TRUE Data of this kind is also called rectangular data, i.e., data that fits into a rectangular table (More on the structure of rectangular data in Section 4.2.). In the example above, every column represents a variable of interest. A (data) variable stores the observations that are of the same kind.12 Common kinds of variables are distinguished based on the structural properties of the kinds of observations that they contain. Common types of empirical data collected are: nominal variable: each observation is an instance of a (finite) set of clearly distinct categories, lacking a natural ordering; binary variable: special case of a nominal variable where there are only two categories; Boolean variable: special case of a binary variable where the two categories are Boolean values “true” and “false”; ordinal variable: each observation is an instance of a (finite) set of clearly distinct and naturally ordered categories, but there is no natural meaning of distance between categories (i.e., it makes sense to say that A is “more” than B but not that A is three times “more” than B); metric variable: each observation is isomorphic to a subset of the reals and interval-scaled (i.e., it makes sense to say that A is three times “more” than B); Examples of some different kinds of variables are shown in Figure 3.2, and Table 3.2 lists common and/or natural ways of representing different kinds of (data) variables in R. Figure 3.2: Examples of different kinds of (data) variables. Table 3.2: Common / natural formats for representing data of different kinds in R. variable type representation in R nominal / binary unordered factor Boolean logical vector ordinal ordered factor metric numeric vector In experimental data, we also distinguish the dependent variable(s) from the independent variable(s). The dependent variables are the variables that we do not control or manipulate in the experiment, but the ones that we are curious to record (e.g., whether a patient recovered from an illness within a week). Dependent variables are also called to-be-explained variables. The independent variables are the variables in the experiment that we manipulate (e.g., which drug to administer), usually with the intention of seeing a particular effect on the dependent variables. Independent variables are also called explanatory variables. Exercise E.1: Variables You are given the following table of observational data: ## # A tibble: 7 x 8 ## name age gender handedness height education `pets?` mood ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 A 24 female right 1.74 undergraduate FALSE neutral ## 2 B 32 non-binary right 1.68 graduate TRUE happy ## 3 C 23 male left 1.62 high school TRUE OK ## 4 D 27 male right 1.84 graduate FALSE very happy ## 5 E 26 non-binary left 1.59 undergraduate FALSE very happy ## 6 F 28 female right 1.66 graduate TRUE OK ## 7 G 35 male right 1.68 high school FALSE neutral For each column, decide which type of variable (nominal, binary, etc.) is stored. Solution name: nominal variable age: metric variable gender: nominal variable handedness: binary variable height: metric variable education: ordinal variable pets?: Boolean variable mood: ordinal variable This sense of “data variable” is not to be confused with the notion of a “random variable”, a concept we will introduce later in Section 7.4. The term “data variable” is not commonly used; the common term is merely “variable”.↩ "],["Chap-02-01-data-exp-design.html", "3.3 Basics of experimental design", " 3.3 Basics of experimental design The most basic template for an experiment, inspired clearly by the natural sciences, is to just measure a quantity of interest (the dependent variable), without taking into account any kind of variation in any kind of independent variables. For instance, we measure the time it takes for an object with a specific shape and weight to hit the ground when dropped from a height of exactly 2 meters. To filter out measurement noise, we do not just record one observation, but take a fair amount. We use the observed times, for instance, to test a theory about acceleration and gravity. Data from such a simple measurement experiment would be just a single vector of numbers. A more elaborate kind of experiment would allow for at least one independent variable. Another archetypical example of an empirical experiment would be a medical study, e.g., one in which we are interested in the effect of a particular drug on the blood pressure of patients. We would then randomly allocate each participant to one of two groups. One group, the treatment group, receives the drug in question; the other group, the control group, receives a placebo (and nobody, not even the experimenter, knows who receives what). After a pre-defined exposure to either drug or placebo, blood pressure (for simplicity, just systolic blood pressure) is measured. The interesting question is whether there is a difference between the measurements across groups. This is a simple example of a one-factor design. The factor in question is which group any particular measurement belongs to. Data from such an experiment could look like this: tribble( ~subj_id, ~group, ~systolic, 1, &quot;treatment&quot;, 118, 2, &quot;control&quot;, 132, 3, &quot;control&quot;, 116, 4, &quot;treatment&quot;, 127, 5, &quot;treatment&quot;, 122 ) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## subj_id group systolic ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 treatment 118 ## 2 2 control 132 ## 3 3 control 116 ## 4 4 treatment 127 ## 5 5 treatment 122 For the purposes of this course, which is not a course on experimental design, just a few key concepts of experimental design are important to be aware of. We will go through some of these issues in the following. 3.3.1 What to analyze? – Dependent variables To begin with, it is important to realize that there is quite some variation in what counts as a dependent variable. Not only can there be more than one dependent variable, but each dependent variable can also be of quite a different type (nominal, ordinal, metric, …), as discussed in the previous section. Moreover, we need to carefully distinguish between the actual measurement/observation and the dependent variable itself. The dependent variable is (usually) what we plot, analyze and discuss, but very often, we measure much more or something else. The dependent variable (of analysis) could well just be one part of the measurement. For example, a standard measure of blood pressure has a number for systolic and another for diastolic pressure. Focussing on just one of these numbers is a (hopefully: theoretically motivated; possibly: arbitrary; in the worst case: result-oriented) decision of the analyst. More interesting examples of such data preprocessing frequently arise in the cognitive sciences, for example: eye-tracking: the measured data are triples consisting of a time-point and two spatial coordinates, but what might be analyzed is just the relative proportion of looks at a particular spatial region of interest (some object on the screen) in a particular temporal region of interest (up to 200 ms after the image appeared); EEG: individual measurements obtained by EEG are very noisy, so that the dependent measure in many analyses is an aggregation over the mean voltage recorded by selected electrodes, where averages are taken for a particular subject over many trials of the same condition (repeated measures) that this subject has seen; But we do not need to go fancy in our experimental methods to see how issues of data processing affect data analysis at its earliest stages, namely by selecting the dependent variable (that which is to be analyzed). Just take the distinction between closed questions and open questions in text-based surveys. In closed questions, participants select an answer from a finite (usually) small number of choices. In open questions, however, they can write text freely, or they can draw, sing, pronounce, gesture, etc. Open response formats are great and naturalistic, but they, too, often require the analyst to carve out a particular aspect of the (rich, natural) observed reality to enter the analysis. 3.3.2 Conditions, trials, items A factorial design is an experiment with at least two independent variables, all of which are (ordered or unordered) factors.13 Factorial designs are often described in terms of short abbreviations. For example, an experiment described as a “\\(2 \\times 3\\) factorial design” would have two factors of interest, the first of which has two levels, the second of which has three levels (such as a distinction between control and treatment group, and an orthogonal distinction of gender in categories ‘male’, ‘female’ and ‘non-binary’). Many psychological studies are factorial designs. Whole batteries of analysis techniques have been developed specifically tuned to these kinds of experiments. For a \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 3\\) factorial design, there are 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 different experimental conditions (also sometimes called design cells). An important distinction in experimental design is whether all participants contribute data to all of the experimental conditions, or whether each only contributes to a part of it. If participants only contribute data to a part of all experimental conditions, this is called a between-subjects design. If all participants contribute data to all experimental conditions, we speak of a within-subjects design. Clearly, sometimes the nature of a design factor determines whether the study can be within-subjects. For example, switching gender for the purpose of a medical study on blood pressure drugs is perhaps a tad much to ask of a participant (though certainly a very enlightening experience). If there is room for the experimenter’s choice of study type, it pays to be aware of some of the clear advantages and drawbacks of either method, as listed in Table 3.3. Table 3.3: Comparison of the pros and cons of between- and within-subjects designs. between-subjects within-subjects no confound between conditions possible cross-contamination between conditions more participants needed fewer participants needed less associated information for analysis more associated data for analysis No matter whether we are dealing with a between- or within-subjects design, another important question is whether each participant gives us only one or more than one observation per cell. If participants contribute more than one observation to a design cell, we speak of a repeated measures design. Such designs are useful as they help separate the signal from the noise (recall the initial example of time measurement from physics). They are also economical because getting several observations worth of relevant data from a single participant for each condition means that we have to get fewer people to do the experiment (normally). However, exposing a participant repeatedly to the same experimental condition can be detrimental to an experiment’s purpose. Participants might recognize the repetition and develop quick coping strategies to deal with the boredom, for example. For this reason, repeated measures designs usually include different kinds of trials: critical trials belong to, roughly put, the actual experiment, e.g., one of the experiment’s design cells; filler trials are packaged around the critical trials to prevent blatant repetition, predictability or recognition of the experiment’s purpose control trials are trials whose data is not used for statistical inference but for checking the quality of the data (e.g., attention checks or tests of whether a participant understood the task correctly) When participants are exposed to several different kinds of trials and even several instances of the same experimental condition, it is also often important to introduce some variability between the instances of the same types of trials. Therefore, psychological experiments often use different items, i.e., different (theoretically exchangeable) instantiations of the same (theoretically important) pattern. For example, if a careful psycholinguist designs a study on the processing of garden-path sentences, she will include not just one example (“The horse raced past the barn fell”) but several (e.g., “Since Jones frequently jogs a mile is a short distance to her”). Item-variability is also important for statistical analyses, as we will see when we talk about hierarchical modeling. In longer experiments, especially within-subjects repeated measures designs in which participants encounter a lot of different items for each experimental condition, clever regimes of randomization are important to minimize the possible effect of carry-over artifacts, for example. A frequent method is pseudo-randomization, where the trial sequence is not completely arbitrary but arbitrary within certain constraints, such as a particular block design, where each block presents an identical number of trials of each type, but each block shuffles the sequence of its types completely at random. The complete opposite of a within-participants repeated measures design is a so-called single-shot experiment in which any participant gives exactly one data point for one experimental condition. 3.3.3 Sample size A very important question for experimental design is that of the sample size: how many data points do we need (per experimental condition)? We will come back to this issue only much later in this course when we talk about statistical inference. This is because the decision of how many, say, participants to invite for a study should ideally be influenced not by the available time and money, but also by statistical considerations of the kind: how many data points do I need in order to obtain a reasonable level of confidence in the resulting statistical inferences I care about? Exercise E.2: Experimental Design Suppose that we want to investigate the effect of caffeine ingestion and time of day on reaction times in solving simple math tasks. The following table shows the measurements of two participants: ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## subject_id `RT (ms)` caffeine `time of day` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 43490 none morning ## 2 1 35200 medium morning ## 3 1 33186 high morning ## 4 1 26350 none afternoon ## 5 1 27004 medium afternoon ## 6 1 26492 high afternoon ## 7 2 42904 none morning ## 8 2 36129 medium morning ## 9 2 30340 high morning ## 10 2 28455 none afternoon ## 11 2 40593 medium afternoon ## 12 2 23992 high afternoon Is this experiment a one-factor or a full factorial design? What is/are the factor(s)? How many levels does each factor have? How many experimental conditions are there? Is it a between- or within-subjects design? What is the dependent variable, what is/are the independent variable(s)? Is this experiment a repeated measures design? Explain your answer. Solution This experiment is a \\(3 \\times 2\\) full factorial design. It has two factors, caffeine (levels: none, medium, high) and time of day (levels: morning, afternoon). There are 3 * 2 = 6 different experimental conditions. Within-subjects design (each participant contributes data to all experimental conditions). Dependent variable: RT (the reaction time) Independent variable 1: caffeine (the caffeine dosage) Independent variable 2: time of day No, each participant contributes exactly one data point per design cell. The archetypical medical experiment discussed above is a one-factor design. In contrast, the term ‘factorial design’ is usually used to refer to what is also often called a full factorial design. These are designs with at least two independent variables.↩ "],["data-wrangling.html", "4 Data Wrangling", " 4 Data Wrangling The information relevant for our analysis goals is not always directly accessible. Sometimes, we must first uncover it effortfully from an inconvenient representation. Also, sometimes data must be cleaned (ideally: by a priori specified criteria) through removing data points that are deemed of insufficient quality for a particular goal. All of this, and more, is the domain of data wrangling: preprocessing, cleaning, reshaping, renaming etc. Section 4.1 describes how to read data from and write data to files. Section 4.2 introduces the concept of tidy data. We then look at a few common tricks of data manipulation in Section 4.3. We will learn about grouping operations in Section 4.4 Finally, we look at a concrete application in Section 4.5.

There is even room for variance in the class of rectangular representations of data. Some manners of representations are more useful for certain purposes than for others. For data analysis (plotting, statistical analyses) we prefer to represent our data as (rectangular) tidy data. 4.2.1 Running example Consider the example of student grades for two exams in a course. A compact way of representing the data for visual digestion is the following representation: exam_results_visual &lt;- tribble( ~exam, ~&quot;Rozz&quot;, ~&quot;Andrew&quot;, ~&quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, &quot;1.3&quot;, &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;1.7&quot;, &quot;final&quot; , &quot;2.3&quot;, &quot;1.7&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot; ) exam_results_visual ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## exam Rozz Andrew Siouxsie ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 midterm 1.3 2.0 1.7 ## 2 final 2.3 1.7 1.0 This is how such data would frequently be represented, e.g., in tables in a journal. Indeed, Rmarkdown helps us present this data in an appetizing manner, e.g., in Table 4.1, which is produced by the code below: knitr::kable( exam_results_visual, caption = &quot;Fictitious exam results of fictitious students.&quot;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 4.1: Fictitious exam results of fictitious students. exam Rozz Andrew Siouxsie midterm 1.3 2.0 1.7 final 2.3 1.7 1.0 Though highly perspicuous, this representation of the data is not tidy, in the special technical sense we endorse here. A tidy representation of the course results could be this: exam_results_tidy &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~exam, ~grade, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 2.0, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 2.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.0 ) exam_results_tidy ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## student exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 ## 2 Andrew midterm 2 ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 ## 6 Siouxsie final 1 4.2.2 Definition of tidy data Following Wickham (2014), a tidy representation of (rectangular) data is defined as one where: each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. Any data set that is not tidy is messy data. Messy data that satisfies the first two contraints, but not the third will be called almost tidy data in this course. We will work, wherever possible, with data that is at least almost tidy. Figure 4.1 shows a graphical representation of the concept of tidy data. Figure 4.1: Organization of tidy data (taken from Wickham and Grolemund (2016)). 4.2.3 Excursion: non-redundant data The final condition in the definition of tidy data is not particularly important for us here (since we will make do with ‘almost tidy data’), but to understand it nonetheless consider the following data set: exam_results_overloaded &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~stu_number, ~exam, ~grade, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;666&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;1969&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 2.0, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;3.14&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;666&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 2.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;1969&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;3.14&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.0 ) exam_results_overloaded ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## student stu_number exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz 666 midterm 1.3 ## 2 Andrew 1969 midterm 2 ## 3 Siouxsie 3.14 midterm 1.7 ## 4 Rozz 666 final 2.3 ## 5 Andrew 1969 final 1.7 ## 6 Siouxsie 3.14 final 1 This table is not tidy in an intuitive sense because it includes redundancy. Why list the student numbers twice, once with each observation of exam score? The table is not tidy in the technical sense that not every observational unit forms a table, i.e., the observation of student numbers and the observation of exam scores should be stored independently in different tables, like so: # same as before exam_results_tidy &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~exam, ~grade, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 2.0, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 2.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.0 ) # additional table with student numbers student_numbers &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~student_number, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;666&quot;, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;1969&quot;, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;3.14&quot; ) Notice that, although the information is distributed over two tibbles, it is linked by the common column student. If we really need to bring all of the information together, the tidyverse has a quick and elegant solution: full_join(exam_results_tidy, student_numbers, by = &quot;student&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## student exam grade student_number ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 666 ## 2 Andrew midterm 2 1969 ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 3.14 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 666 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 1969 ## 6 Siouxsie final 1 3.14 Exercise E.1: Tidy or Untidy? Lets take a look at this made up data set: data &lt;- tribble( ~subject_id, ~choices, ~reaction_times, 1, &quot;A,B,B&quot;, &quot;312 433 365&quot;, 2, &quot;B,A,B&quot;, &quot;393 491 327&quot;, 3, &quot;B,A,A&quot;, &quot;356 313 475&quot;, 4, &quot;A,B,B&quot;, &quot;292 352 378&quot;) Is this data tidy or untidy? Explain your reasoning. Solution This data is untidy for given reasons: Each row contains more than one observation. Most fields contain more than one value. References "],["Chap-02-02-data-preprocessing-cleaning.html", "4.3 Data manipulation: the basics", " 4.3 Data manipulation: the basics 4.3.1 Pivoting The tidyverse strongly encourages the use of tidy data, or at least almost tidy data. If your data is (almost) tidy, you can be reasonably sure that you can plot and analyze the data without additional wrangling. If your data is not (almost) tidy because it is too wide or too long (see below), what is required is a joyful round of pivoting. There are two directions of pivoting: making data longer, and making data wider. 4.3.1.1 Making too wide data longer with pivot_longer Consider the previous example of messy data again: exam_results_visual &lt;- tribble( ~exam, ~&quot;Rozz&quot;, ~&quot;Andrew&quot;, ~&quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, &quot;1.3&quot;, &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;1.7&quot;, &quot;final&quot; , &quot;2.3&quot;, &quot;1.7&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot; ) exam_results_visual ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## exam Rozz Andrew Siouxsie ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 midterm 1.3 2.0 1.7 ## 2 final 2.3 1.7 1.0 This data is “too wide”. We can make it longer with the function pivot_longer from the tidyr package. Check out the example below before we plunge into a description of pivot_longer. exam_results_visual %&gt;% pivot_longer( # pivot every column except the first cols = - 1, # name of new column which contains the # names of the columns to be &quot;gathered&quot; names_to = &quot;student&quot;, # name of new column which contains the values # of the cells which now form a new column values_to = &quot;grade&quot; ) %&gt;% # optional reordering of columns (to make # the output exactly like `exam_results_tidy`) select(student, exam, grade) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## student exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 ## 2 Andrew midterm 2.0 ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 ## 6 Siouxsie final 1.0 What pivot_longer does, in general, is take a bunch of columns and gather the values of all cells in these columns into a single, new column, the so-called value column, i.e., the column with the values of the cells to be gathered. If pivot_longer stopped here, we would loose information about which cell values belonged to which original column. Therefore, pivot_longer also creates a second new column, the so-called name column, i.e., the column with the names of the original columns that we gathered together. Consequently, in order to do its job, pivot_longer minimally needs three pieces of information:15 which columns to spin around (function argument cols) the name of the to-be-created new value column (function argument values_to) the name of the to-be-created new name column (function argument names_to) For different ways of selecting columns to pivot around, see Section 4.3.3 below. 4.3.1.2 Making too long data wider with pivot_wider Consider the following example of data which is untidy because it is too long: mixed_results_too_long &lt;- tibble(student = rep(c(&#39;Rozz&#39;, &#39;Andrew&#39;, &#39;Siouxsie&#39;), times = 2), what = rep(c(&#39;grade&#39;, &#39;participation&#39;), each = 3), howmuch = c(2.7, 2.0, 1.0, 75, 93, 33)) mixed_results_too_long ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## student what howmuch ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz grade 2.7 ## 2 Andrew grade 2 ## 3 Siouxsie grade 1 ## 4 Rozz participation 75 ## 5 Andrew participation 93 ## 6 Siouxsie participation 33 This data is untidy because it lumps two types of different measurements (a course grade, and the percentage of participation) in a single column. These are different variables, and so should be represented in different columns. To fix a data representation that is too long, we can make it wider with the help of the pivot_wider function from the tidyr package. We look at an example before looking at the general behavior of the pivot_wider function. mixed_results_too_long %&gt;% pivot_wider( # column containing the names of the new columns names_from = what, # column containing the values of the new columns values_from = howmuch ) ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## student grade participation ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz 2.7 75 ## 2 Andrew 2 93 ## 3 Siouxsie 1 33 In general, pivot_wider picks out two columns, one column of values to distribute into new to-be-created columns, and one vector of names or groups which contains the information about the, well, names of the to-be-created new columns. There are more refined options for pivot_wider some of which we will encounter in the context of concrete cases of application. 4.3.2 Subsetting row &amp; columns If a data set contains too much information for your current purposes, you can discard irrelevant (or unhelpful) rows and columns. The function filter takes a Boolean expression and returns only those rows of which the Boolean expression is true: exam_results_tidy %&gt;% # keep only entries with grades better than 1.7 filter(grade &lt;= 1.7) ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## student exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 ## 2 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 ## 3 Andrew final 1.7 ## 4 Siouxsie final 1 To select rows by an index or a vector of indeces, use the slice function: exam_results_tidy %&gt;% # keep only entries from rows with an even index dplyr::slice(c(2,4,6)) # explicit call to avoid name clash (package &#39;greta&#39;) ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## student exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Andrew midterm 2 ## 2 Rozz final 2.3 ## 3 Siouxsie final 1 The function select allows to pick out a subset of columns. Interestingly, it can also be used to reorder columns, because the order in which column names are specified matches the order in the returned tibble. exam_results_tidy %&gt;% # select columns `grade` and `name` select(grade, exam) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## grade exam ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1.3 midterm ## 2 2 midterm ## 3 1.7 midterm ## 4 2.3 final ## 5 1.7 final ## 6 1 final 4.3.3 Tidy selection of column names To select the colums in several functions within the tidyverse, such as pivot_longer or select, there are useful helper functions from the tidyselect package. Here are some examples:16 # bogus code for illustration of possibilities! SOME_DATA %&gt;% select( ... # could be one of the following # all columns indexed 2, 3, ..., 10 2:10 # all columns except the one called &quot;COLNAME&quot; - COLNAME # all columns with names starting with &quot;STRING&quot; ... starts_with(&quot;STRING&quot;) # all columns with names ending with &quot;STRING&quot; ... ends_with(&quot;STRING&quot;) # all columns with names containing &quot;STRING&quot; ... contains(&quot;STRING&quot;) # all columns with names of the form &quot;Col_i&quot; with i = 1, ..., 10 ... num_range(&quot;Col_&quot;, 1:10) ) 4.3.4 Adding, changing and renaming columns To add a new column, or to change an existing one use function mutate, like so: exam_results_tidy %&gt;% mutate( # add a new column called &#39;passed&#39; depending on grade # [NB: severe passing conditions in this class!!] passed = grade &lt;= 1.7, # change an existing column; here: change # character column &#39;exam&#39; to ordered factor exam = factor(exam, ordered = T) ) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## student exam grade passed ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 TRUE ## 2 Andrew midterm 2 FALSE ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 TRUE ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 FALSE ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 TRUE ## 6 Siouxsie final 1 TRUE If you want to rename a column, function rename is what you want: exam_results_tidy %&gt;% # rename existing colum &quot;student&quot; to new name &quot;participant&quot; # [NB: rename takes the new name first] rename(participant = student) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## participant exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 ## 2 Andrew midterm 2 ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 ## 6 Siouxsie final 1 4.3.5 Splitting and uniting columns Here is data from course homework: homework_results_untidy &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~results, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;1.0,2.3,3.0&quot;, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;2.3,2.7,1.3&quot;, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;1.7,4.0,1.0&quot; ) This is not a useful representation format. Results of three homework sets are mushed together in a single column. Each value is separated by a comma, but it is all stored as a character vector. To disentangle information in a single column, use the separate function: homework_results_untidy %&gt;% separate( # which column to split up col = results, # names of the new column to store results into = str_c(&quot;HW_&quot;, 1:3), # separate by which character / reg-exp sep = &quot;,&quot;, # automatically (smart-)convert the type of the new cols convert = T ) ## # A tibble: 3 x 4 ## student HW_1 HW_2 HW_3 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz 1 2.3 3 ## 2 Andrew 2.3 2.7 1.3 ## 3 Siouxsie 1.7 4 1 If you have a reason to perform the reverse operation, i.e., join together several columns, use the unite function. 4.3.6 Sorting a data set If you want to indicate a fixed order of the reoccurring elements in a (character) vector, e.g., for plotting in a particular order, you should make this column an ordered factor. But if you want to order a data set along a column, e.g., for inspection or printing as a table, then you can do that by using the arrange function. You can specify several columns to sort alpha-numerically in ascending order, and also indicate a descending order using the desc function: exam_results_tidy %&gt;% arrange(desc(student), grade) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## student exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Siouxsie final 1 ## 2 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 ## 3 Rozz midterm 1.3 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 ## 6 Andrew midterm 2 4.3.7 Combining tibbles There are frequently occasions on which data from two separate variables needs to be combined. The simplest case is where two entirely disjoint data sets merely need to be glued together, either horizontally (binding columns together with function cbind) or vertically (binding rows together with function rbind). new_exam_results_tidy &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~exam, ~grade, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;bonus&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;bonus&quot;, 2.3, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;bonus&quot;, 1.0 ) rbind( exam_results_tidy, new_exam_results_tidy ) ## # A tibble: 9 x 3 ## student exam grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 ## 2 Andrew midterm 2 ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 ## 6 Siouxsie final 1 ## 7 Rozz bonus 1.7 ## 8 Andrew bonus 2.3 ## 9 Siouxsie bonus 1 If two data sets have information in common, and the combination should respect that commonality, the join family of functions is of great help. Consider the case of distributed information again that we looked at to understand the third constraint of the concept of “tidy data”. There are two tibbles, both of which contain information about the same students. They share the column student (this does not necessarily have to be in the same order!) and we might want to join the information from both sources into a single (messy but almost tidy) representation, using full_join. We have seen an example already, which is repeated here: # same as before exam_results_tidy &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~exam, ~grade, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 2.0, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;midterm&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 2.3, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.7, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;final&quot;, 1.0 ) # additional table with student numbers student_numbers &lt;- tribble( ~student, ~student_number, &quot;Rozz&quot;, &quot;666&quot;, &quot;Andrew&quot;, &quot;1969&quot;, &quot;Siouxsie&quot;, &quot;3.14&quot; ) full_join(exam_results_tidy, student_numbers, by = &quot;student&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## student exam grade student_number ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 666 ## 2 Andrew midterm 2 1969 ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 3.14 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 666 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 1969 ## 6 Siouxsie final 1 3.14 Exercise E.2: Data Wrangling in R We are working with the same example as in the earlier exercise: data &lt;- tribble( ~subject_id, ~choices, ~reaction_times, 1, &quot;A,B,B&quot;, &quot;312 433 365&quot;, 2, &quot;B,A,B&quot;, &quot;393 491 327&quot;, 3, &quot;B,A,A&quot;, &quot;356 313 475&quot;, 4, &quot;A,B,B&quot;, &quot;292 352 378&quot; ) Take a look at the following code snippet. Explain what the individual parts (indicated by the numbers) do. What will the result look like? choice_data &lt;- data %&gt;% #1 select(subject_id,choices) %&gt;% #2 separate( col = choices, into = str_c(&quot;C_&quot;,1:3), sep = &quot;,&quot;) %&gt;% #3 pivot_longer( cols = -1, names_to =&quot;condition&quot;, values_to = &quot;response&quot;) Solution Selecting two columns (subject_id and choices) out of the data set. In the data set, each cell in the choices column contains more than one value. To separate them, we take this column and divide the strings by the “,”. The names are then given for each line from one to three. Now we are making the data set longer, so that each condition is its own row. We are pivoting each column apart from the first. The names of the columns are combined in a column called condition and the values are put into a column called response. The result: choice_data ## # A tibble: 12 x 3 ## subject_id condition response ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 C_1 A ## 2 1 C_2 B ## 3 1 C_3 B ## 4 2 C_1 B ## 5 2 C_2 A ## 6 2 C_3 B ## 7 3 C_1 B ## 8 3 C_2 A ## 9 3 C_3 A ## 10 4 C_1 A ## 11 4 C_2 B ## 12 4 C_3 B If two data sets are to be joined by a column that is not exactly shared by both sets (one contains entries in this columns that the other doesn’t) then a full_join will retain all information from both. If that is not what you want, check out alternative functions like right_join, semi_join etc. using the data wrangling cheat sheet. There are alternative possibilities for specifying names of the value and name column, which allow for more dynamic construction of strings. We will not cover all of these details here, but we will use some of these alternative specifications in subsequent examples.↩ The helpers from the tidyselect package also accept regular expressions.↩ "],["Chap-02-02-data-grouping-nesting.html", "4.4 Grouped operations", " 4.4 Grouped operations A frequently occurring problem in data analysis is to obtain a summary statistic (see Section 5) for different subsets of data. For example, we might want to calculate the average score for each student in our class. We could do that by filtering like so (notice that pull gives you the column vector specified): # extracting mean grade for Rozz mean_grade_Rozz &lt;- exam_results_tidy %&gt;% filter(student == &quot;Rozz&quot;) %&gt;% pull(grade) %&gt;% mean mean_grade_Rozz ## [1] 1.8 But then we need to do that two more times, as we shouldn’t copy-paste code, we write a function and use mutate to add a mean for each student: get_mean_for_student = function(student_name) { exam_results_tidy %&gt;% filter(student == student_name) %&gt;% pull(grade) %&gt;% mean } map_dbl( exam_results_tidy %&gt;% pull(student) %&gt;% unique, get_mean_for_student ) ## [1] 1.80 1.85 1.35 Also not quite satisfactory, clumsy and error-prone. Enter, grouping in the tidyverse. If we want to apply a particular operation to all combinations of levels of different variables (no matter whether they are encoded as factors or not when we group), we can do this with the function group_by, followed by either a call to mutate or summarise. Check this example: exam_results_tidy %&gt;% group_by(student) %&gt;% summarise( student_mean = mean(grade) ) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## student student_mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Andrew 1.85 ## 2 Rozz 1.8 ## 3 Siouxsie 1.35 The funciton summarise returns a single row for each combination of levels of grouping variables. If we use the function mutate instead, the summary statistic is added (repeatedly) in each of the original rows: exam_results_tidy %&gt;% group_by(student) %&gt;% mutate( student_mean = mean(grade) ) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## # Groups: student [3] ## student exam grade student_mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Rozz midterm 1.3 1.8 ## 2 Andrew midterm 2 1.85 ## 3 Siouxsie midterm 1.7 1.35 ## 4 Rozz final 2.3 1.8 ## 5 Andrew final 1.7 1.85 ## 6 Siouxsie final 1 1.35 The latter can sometimes be handy, for example when overlaying a plot of the data with grouped means, for instance. It may be important to remember that after a call of group_by, the resulting tibbles retains the grouping information for all subsequent operations. To remove grouping information, use the function ungroup.

Here, we do not since we also have strong, more specific filters on comprehension (see below). Since we are not going to use this information later on, we might as well discard it now: data_KoF_raw &lt;- data_KoF_raw %&gt;% select(-languages, - comments, -age, - RT, - education, - gender) But even after pruning irrelevant columns, this data set is still not ideal. We need to preprocess it more thoroughly to make it more intuitively managable. For example, the information in column trial_name does not give the trial’s name in an intuitive sense, but its type: whether it is a practice or a main trial. But this information, and more, is also represented in the column trial_type. The column item_version contains information about the experimental condition. To see this (mess) the code below prints the selected information from the main trials of only one participant in an order that makes it easier to see what is what. data_KoF_raw %&gt;% # ignore practice trials for the moment # focus on one participant only filter(trial_type != &quot;practice&quot;, submission_id == 192) %&gt;% select(trial_type, item_version, question) %&gt;% arrange(desc(trial_type), item_version) %&gt;% print(n = Inf) ## # A tibble: 24 x 3 ## trial_type item_version question ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 special none The Pope is currently not married. ## 2 special none Germany has volcanoes. ## 3 special none France has a king. ## 4 special none Canada is a democracy. ## 5 special none Belgium has rainforests. ## 6 main 0 The volcanoes of Germany dominate the landscape. ## 7 main 1 Canada has an emperor, and he is fond of sushi. ## 8 main 10 Donald Trump, his favorite nature spot is not the Be… ## 9 main 6 The King of France isn’t bald. ## 10 main 9 The Pope’s wife, she did not invite Angela Merkel fo… ## 11 filler none The Solar System includes the planet Earth. ## 12 filler none Vatican City is the world&#39;s largest country by land … ## 13 filler none Big Ben is a very large building in the middle of Pa… ## 14 filler none Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written b… ## 15 filler none Taj Mahal is a mausoleum on the bank of the river in… ## 16 filler none James Bond is a spanish dancer from Madrid. ## 17 filler none The Pacific Ocean is a large ocean between Japan and… ## 18 filler none Australia has a very large border with Brazil. ## 19 filler none Steve Jobs was an American inventor and co-founder o… ## 20 filler none Planet Earth is part of the galaxy ‘Milky Way’. ## 21 filler none Germany shares borders with France, Belgium and Denm… ## 22 filler none Antarctica is a continent covered almost completely … ## 23 filler none The Statue of Liberty is a colossal sculpture on Lib… ## 24 filler none English is the main language in Australia, Britain a… We see that the information in item_version specifies the critical condition. To make this more intuitively manageable, we would like to have a column called condition and it should, ideally, also contain useful information for the cases where trial_type is not main or special. That is why we will therefore remove the column trial_name completely, and create an informative column condition in which we learn of every row whether it belongs to one of the 5 experimental conditions, and if not whether it is a filler or a “background check” (= special) trial. data_KoF_processed &lt;- data_KoF_raw %&gt;% # drop redundant information in column `trial_name` select(-trial_name) %&gt;% # discard practice trials filter(trial_type != &quot;practice&quot;) %&gt;% mutate( # add a &#39;condition&#39; variable condition = case_when( trial_type == &quot;special&quot; ~ &quot;background check&quot;, trial_type == &quot;main&quot; ~ str_c(&quot;Condition &quot;, item_version), TRUE ~ &quot;filler&quot; ) %&gt;% # make the new &#39;condition&#39; variable a factor factor( ordered = T, levels = c( str_c(&quot;Condition &quot;, c(0, 1, 6, 9, 10)), &quot;background check&quot;, &quot;filler&quot; ) ) ) # write_csv(data_KoF_processed, &quot;data_sets/king-of-france_data_processed.csv&quot;) 4.5.1 Cleaning the data We clean the data in two consecutive steps: Remove all data from any participant who got more than 50% of the answers to the filler material wrong.

This single number might, for example, indicate the maximum or minimum value of a vector of one billion observations. The large data set (one billion observations) is reduced to a single number which represents one aspect of that data. Summary statistics are, as a general (but violable) rule, many-to-one surjections. They compress complex information into a simpler, compressed representation. Summary statistics are useful for understanding the data at hand, for communication about a data set, but also for subsequent statistical analyses. As we will see later on, many statistical tests look at a summary statistic \\(x\\), which is a single value derived from data set \\(D\\), and compare \\(x\\) to an expectation of what \\(x\\) should be like if the process that generated \\(D\\) really had a particular property. For the moment, however, we use summary statistics only to get comfortable with data: understanding it better and gaining competence to manipulate it. Chapter 5.1 first uses the Bio-Logic Jazz-Metal data set to look at a very intuitive class of summary statistics for categorical data, namely counts and proportions. Chapter 5.2 introduces summary statistics for simple, one-dimensional vectors with numeric information. In doing so, we will also learn about nested tibbles. Chapter 5.3 looks at measures of the relation between two numerical vectors, namely covariance and correlation. These last two chapters use the avocado data set. The learning goals for this chapter are: become able to compute counts and frequencies for categorical data understand and be able to compute summary statistics for one-dimensional metric data: measures of central tendency mean, mode, median measures of dispersion variance, standard deviation, quantiles non-parametric estimates of confidence bootstrapped CI of the mean understand and be able to compute for two-dimensional metric data: covariance Bravais-Pearson correlation "],["Chap-02-03-summary-statistics-counts.html", "5.1 Counts and proportions", " 5.1 Counts and proportions Very familiar instances of summary statistics are counts and frequencies. While there is no conceptual difficulty in understanding these numerical measures, we have yet to see how to obtain counts for categorical data in R.

It works inside of summarise and mutate and is usually applied to grouped data sets. For example, we can get a count of how many observations the data in data_BLJM_processed contains for each condition by first grouping by variable condition and then calling n (without arguments) inside of summarise: data_BLJM_processed %&gt;% group_by(condition) %&gt;% summarise(nr_observation_per_condition = n()) %&gt;% ungroup() ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## condition nr_observation_per_condition ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 BM 102 ## 2 JM 102 ## 3 LB 102 Notice that calling n without grouping just gives you the number of rows in the data set: data_BLJM_processed %&gt;% summarize(n_rows = n()) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## n_rows ## &lt;int&gt; ## 1 306 This can also be obtained simply by (although in a different output format!): nrow(data_BLJM_processed) ## [1] 306 Counting can be helpful also when getting acquainted with a data set, or when checking whether the data is complete. For example, we can verify that every participant in the experiment contributed three data points like so: data_BLJM_processed %&gt;% group_by(submission_id) %&gt;% summarise(nr_data_points = n()) ## # A tibble: 102 x 2 ## submission_id nr_data_points ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 278 3 ## 2 279 3 ## 3 280 3 ## 4 281 3 ## 5 282 3 ## 6 283 3 ## 7 284 3 ## 8 285 3 ## 9 286 3 ## 10 287 3 ## # … with 92 more rows The functions tally and count are essentially just convenience wrappers around n. While tally expects that the data is already grouped in the relevant way, count takes a column specification as an argument and does the grouping (and final ungrouping) implicitly. For instance, the following code blocks produce the same output, one using n, the other using count, namely the total number of times a particular response has been given in a particular condition: data_BLJM_processed %&gt;% group_by(condition, response) %&gt;% summarise(n = n()) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## # Groups: condition [3] ## condition response n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 BM Beach 44 ## 2 BM Mountains 58 ## 3 JM Jazz 64 ## 4 JM Metal 38 ## 5 LB Biology 58 ## 6 LB Logic 44 data_BLJM_processed %&gt;% # function `count` is masked by another package, must call explicitly dplyr::count(condition, response) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## condition response n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 BM Beach 44 ## 2 BM Mountains 58 ## 3 JM Jazz 64 ## 4 JM Metal 38 ## 5 LB Biology 58 ## 6 LB Logic 44 So, these counts suggest that there is an overall preference for mountains over beaches, Jazz over Metal and Biology over Logic. Who would have known!? These counts are overall numbers. They do not tell us anything about any potentially interesting relationship between preferences. So, let’s have a closer look at the number of people who selected which music-subject pair. We collect these counts in variable BLJM_associated_counts. We first need to pivot the data, using pivot_wider, to make sure each participant’s choices are associated with each other, and then take the counts of interest: BLJM_associated_counts &lt;- data_BLJM_processed %&gt;% select(submission_id, condition, response) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = condition, values_from = response) %&gt;% # drop the Beach vs. Mountain condition select(-BM) %&gt;% dplyr::count(JM,LB) BLJM_associated_counts ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## JM LB n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Jazz Biology 38 ## 2 Jazz Logic 26 ## 3 Metal Biology 20 ## 4 Metal Logic 18 We can also produce a table of proportions from this, simply by dividing the column called n by the total number of observations using sum(n). We can also flip the table around into a more convenient (though messy) representation: BLJM_associated_counts %&gt;% # look at relative frequency, not total counts mutate(n = n / sum(n)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = LB, values_from = n) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## JM Biology Logic ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Jazz 0.373 0.255 ## 2 Metal 0.196 0.176 Eye-balling this table of relative frequencies, we might indeed hypothesize that preference for musical style is not independent of preference for an academic subject. The impression is corroborated by looking at the plot in Figure 5.1. More on this later! Figure 5.1: Proportions of jointly choosing a musical style and an academic subfield in the Bio-Logic Jazz-Metal data set. Useful base R functions for obtaining counts are table and prop.table.↩ "],["Chap-02-03-summary-statistics-1D.html", "5.2 Central tendency and dispersion", " 5.2 Central tendency and dispersion This section will look at two types of summary statistics: measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Measures of central tendency map a vector of observations onto a single number that represents, roughly put, “the center”. Since what counts as a “center” is ambiguous, there are several measures of central tendencies. Different measures of central tendencies can be more or less adequate for one purpose or another. The type of variable (nominal, ordinal or metric, for instance) will also influence the choice of measure. We will visit three prominent measures of central tendency here: (arithmetic) mean, median and mode. Measures of dispersion indicate how much the observations are spread out around, let’s say, “a center”. We will visit three prominent measures of dispersion: the variance, the standard deviation and quantiles. To illustrate these ideas, consider the case of a numeric vector of observations. Central tendency and dispersion together describe a (numeric) vector by giving indicative information about the point around which the observations spread, and how far away from that middle point they tend to lie. Fictitious examples of observation vectors with higher or lower central tendency and higher or lower dispersion are given in Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2: Fictitious data points with higher/lower central tendencies and higher/lower dispersion. NB: The points are ‘jittered’ along the vertical dimension for better visibility; only the horizontal dimension is relevant here. 5.2.1 The data for the remainder of the chapter In the remainder of this chapter, we will use the avocado data set, a very simple and theory-free example in which we can explore two metric variables: the average price at which avocados were sold during specific intervals of time and the total amount of avocados sold. Please check Appendix Chapter ?? for more information on this data set. We load the data into a variable named avocado_data but also immediately rename some of the columns to have more convenient handles (see also Appendix Chapter ??): avocado_data &lt;- read_csv(url(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-franke/intro-data-analysis/master/data_sets/avocado.csv&#39;)) %&gt;% # remove currently irrelevant columns select( -X1 , - contains(&quot;Bags&quot;), - year, - region) %&gt;% # rename variables of interest for convenience rename( total_volume_sold = `Total Volume`, average_price = `AveragePrice`, small = &#39;4046&#39;, medium = &#39;4225&#39;, large = &#39;4770&#39;, ) We can then take a glimpse: avocado_data ## # A tibble: 18,249 x 7 ## Date average_price total_volume_sold small medium large type ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2015-12-27 1.33 64237. 1037. 54455. 48.2 conventional ## 2 2015-12-20 1.35 54877. 674. 44639. 58.3 conventional ## 3 2015-12-13 0.93 118220. 795. 109150. 130. conventional ## 4 2015-12-06 1.08 78992. 1132 71976. 72.6 conventional ## 5 2015-11-29 1.28 51040. 941. 43838. 75.8 conventional ## 6 2015-11-22 1.26 55980. 1184. 48068. 43.6 conventional ## 7 2015-11-15 0.99 83454. 1369. 73673. 93.3 conventional ## 8 2015-11-08 0.98 109428. 704. 101815. 80 conventional ## 9 2015-11-01 1.02 99811. 1022. 87316. 85.3 conventional ## 10 2015-10-25 1.07 74339. 842. 64757. 113 conventional ## # … with 18,239 more rows The columns that will interest us the most in this chapter are: average_price - average price of a single avocado total_volume_sold - total number of avocados sold type - whether the price/amount is for a conventional or an organic avocado In particular, we will look at summary statistics for the average_price and total_volume_sold, either for the whole data set or independently for each type of avocado. Notice that both of these variables are numeric. They are vectors of numbers, each representing an observation. 5.2.2 Measures of central tendency 5.2.2.1 The (arithmetic) mean If \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle x_1, \\dots , x_n \\rangle\\) is a vector of \\(n\\) observations with \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) for all \\(1 \\le i \\le n\\), the (arithmetic) mean of \\(x\\), written \\(\\mu_{\\vec{x}}\\), is defined as \\[\\mu_{\\vec{x}} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\,.\\] The arithmetic mean can be understood intuitively as the center of gravity. If we place a marble on a wooden board for every \\(x_i\\), such that every marble is equally heavy and the differences between all data measurements are identical to the distances between the marbles, the arithmetic mean is where you can balance the board with the tip of your finger. Example. The mean of the vector \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle 0, 3, 6, 7\\rangle\\) is \\(\\mu_{\\vec{x}} = \\frac{0 + 3 + 6 + 7}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4\\,.\\) The black dots in the graph below show the data observations, and the red cross indicates the mean. Notice that the mean is clearly not the mid-point between the maximum and the minimum (which here would be 3.5). To calculate the mean of a large vector, R has a built-in function mean, which we have in fact used frequently before. Let’s use it to calculate the mean of the variable average_price for different types of avocados: avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% summarise( mean_price = mean(average_price) ) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## type mean_price ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 conventional 1.16 ## 2 organic 1.65 Unsurprisingly, the overall mean of the observed prices is (numerically) higher for organic avocados than for conventional ones. Excursion. It is also possible to conceptualize the arithmetic mean as the expected value when sampling from the observed data. This is useful for linking the mean of a data sample to the expected value of a random variable, a concept we will introduce in Chapter 7. Suppose you have gathered the data \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle 0, 3, 6, 7\\rangle\\). What is the expected value that you think you will obtain if you sample from this data vector once? – Wait! What does that even mean? Expected value? Sampling once? Suppose that some joker from around town invites you for a game. The game goes like this: The joker puts a ball in an urn, one for each data observation. The joker writes the observed value on the ball corresponding to that value. You pay the joker a certain amount of money to be allowed to draw one ball from the urn. The balls are indistinguishable and the process of drawing is entirely fair. You receive the number corresponding to the ball you drew paid out in silver coins. (For simplicity, we assume that all numbers are non-negative, but that is not crucial. If a negative number is drawn, you just have to pay the joker that amount.) How many silver coins would you maximally pay to play one round? Well, of course, no more than four (unless you value gaming on top of silver)! This is because 4 is the expected value of drawing once. This, in turn, is because every ball has a chance of 0.25 of being drawn. So you can expect to earn 0 silver with a 25% chance, 3 with a 25% chance, 6 with a 25% chance and 7 with a 25% chance. In this sense, the mean is the expected value of sampling once from the observed data. 5.2.2.2 The median If \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle x_1, \\dots , x_n \\rangle\\) is a vector of \\(n\\) data observations from an at least ordinal measure and if \\(\\vec{x}\\) is ordered such that for all \\(1 \\le i &lt; n\\) we have \\(x_i \\le x_{i+1}\\), the median is the value \\(x_i\\) such that the number of data observations that are bigger or equal to \\(x_i\\) and the number of data observations that are smaller or equal to \\(x_i\\) are equal. Notice that this definition may yield no unique median. In that case, different alternative strategies are used, depending on the data type at hand (ordinal or metric). (See also the example below.) The median corresponds to the 50% quartile, a concept introduced below. Example. The median of the vector \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle 0, 3, 6, 7 \\rangle\\) does not exist by the definition given above. However, for metric measures, where distances between measurements are meaningful, it is customary to take the two values “closest to where the median should be” and average them. In the example at hand, this would be \\(\\frac{3 + 6}{2} = 4.5\\). The plot below shows the data points in black, the mean as a red cross (as before) and the median as a blue circle. The function median from base R computes the median of a vector. It also takes an ordered factor as an argument. median(c(0, 3, 6, 7 )) ## [1] 4.5 To please the avocados, let’s also calculate the median price of both types of avocados and compare these to the means we calculated earlier already: avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% summarise( mean_price = mean(average_price), median_price = median(average_price) ) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## type mean_price median_price ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 conventional 1.16 1.13 ## 2 organic 1.65 1.63 5.2.2.3 The mode The mode is the value that occurred most frequently in the data. While the mean is only applicable to metric variables, and the median only to variables that are at least ordinal, the mode is only reasonable for variables that have a finite set of different possible observations (nominal or ordinal). There is no built-in function in R to return the mode of a (suitable) vector, but it is easily retrieved by obtaining counts. Exercise E.1: Mean, median, mode Compute the mean, median and mode of data vector \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle1,2,4,10\\rangle\\). Now add two numbers to the vector such that the median stays the same, but mode and mean change. Decide for the following statements whether they are true or false: The mean is a measure of central tendency, which can be quite sensitive to even single outliers in the data. If \\(\\vec{x}\\) is a vector of binary Boolean outcomes, we can retrieve the proportion of occurrences of TRUE in \\(\\vec{x}\\) by the R function mean(x). Solution Mean: \\(\\frac{1+2+4+10}{4}=\\frac{17}{4}=4.25\\) Median: \\(\\frac{2+4}{2}=3\\) Mode: all values are equally frequent, so all are a mode. Numbers to add: \\(1, 10 \\to \\vec{x} = \\langle1,1,2,4,10,10\\rangle\\) New mean: \\(\\frac{1+1+2+4+10+10}{6}=\\frac{28}{6}\\approx4.67\\) New mode: \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) Both statements are correct. 5.2.3 Measures of dispersion 5.2.3.1 Variance The variance is a widely used and very useful measure of dispersion for metric data. The variance \\(\\text{Var}(\\vec{x})\\) of a vector of metric observations \\(\\vec{x}\\) of length \\(n\\) is defined as the average of the squared distances from the mean: \\[\\text{Var}(\\vec{x}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu_{\\vec{x}})^2\\] Example. The variance of the vector \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle 0, 3, 6, 7 \\rangle\\) is computed as: \\[\\text{Var}(\\vec{x}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\ \\left ( (0-4)^2 + (3-4)^2 + (6-4)^2 + (7-4)^2 \\right ) = \\] \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\ (16 + 1 + 4 + 9) = \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5\\] Figure 5.3 shows a geometric interpretation of the variance for the running example of vector \\(\\vec{x} = \\langle 0, 3, 6, 7 \\rangle\\). Figure 5.3: Geometrical interpretation of variance. Four data points (black dots) and their mean (red cross) are shown, together with the squares whose sides are the differences between the observed data points and the mean. The numbers in white give the area of each square, which is also indicated by the coloring of each rectangle. We can calculate the variance in R explicitly: x &lt;- c(0, 3, 6, 7) sum((x - mean(x))^2) / length(x) ## [1] 7.5 There is also a built-in function var from base R. Using this we get a different result though: x &lt;- c(0, 3, 6, 7) var(x) ## [1] 10 This is because var computes the variance by a slightly different formula to obtain an unbiased estimator of the variance for the case that the mean is not known but also estimated from the data. The formula for the unbiased estimator that R uses, simply replaces the \\(n\\) in the denominator by \\(n-1\\):18 \\[\\text{Var}(\\vec{x}) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu_{\\vec{x}})^2\\] 5.2.3.2 Standard deviation The standard deviation \\(\\text{SD}(\\vec{x})\\) of numeric vector \\(\\vec{x}\\) is just the square root of the variance: \\[ \\text{SD}(\\vec{x}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\vec{x})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu_{\\vec{x}})^2}\\] Let’s calculate the (unbiased) variance and standard deviation for the average_price of different types of avocados: avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% summarize( variance_price = var(average_price), stddev_price = sd(average_price), ) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## type variance_price stddev_price ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 conventional 0.0692 0.263 ## 2 organic 0.132 0.364 5.2.3.3 Quantile For a vector \\(\\vec{x}\\) of at least ordinal measures, we can generalize the concept of a median to an arbitrary quantile. A \\(k\\)% quantile is the element \\(x_i\\) in \\(\\vec{x}\\), such that \\(k\\)% of the data in \\(\\vec{x}\\) lies below \\(x_i\\). If this definition does not yield a unique element for some \\(k\\)% threshold, similar methods to what we saw for the median are applied. We can use the base R function quantile to obtain the 10%, 25%, 50% and 85% quantiles (just arbitrary picks) for the average_price in the avocado data set: quantile( # vector of observations x = avocado_data$average_price, # which quantiles probs = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.85) ) ## 10% 25% 50% 85% ## 0.93 1.10 1.37 1.83 This tells us, for instance, that only about ten percent of the data observations had prices lower than $0.93. Exercise E.2: Variance, standard deviation, quantiles Compute the unbiased variance and standard deviation of data vector \\(\\vec{y} = \\langle4,2,6,8\\rangle\\). Below, you see several normal distributions with differing means \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviations \\(\\sigma\\). The red, unnumbered distribution is the so-called standard normal distribution; it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Compare each distribution below (1-4) to the standard normal distribution and think about how the parameters of the standard normal were changed. Also, think about which distribution (1-4) has the smallest/largest mean and the smallest/largest standard deviation. Decide for the following statements whether they are true or false: The median is the 50% quantile. A 10% quantile of 0.2 indicates that 10% of the data observations are above 0.2. The 85% quantile of a vector with unequal numbers always has a larger value than the 25% quantile. Solution \\[\\begin{align} \\mu_{\\vec{y}} &amp;= \\frac{4+2+6+8}{4}=5 \\\\ Var(\\vec{y}) &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i-\\mu_{\\vec{y}})^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{4-1}((4-5)^2+(2-5)^2+(6-5)^2+(8-5)^2) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{3}(1+9+1+9) = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67 \\\\ SD(\\vec{y}) &amp;= \\sqrt{Var(\\vec{y})} = \\sqrt{6.67} \\approx 2.58 \\end{align}\\] Distribution 1 (\\(\\mu\\) = 5, \\(\\sigma\\) = 1): larger mean, same standard deviation Distribution 2 (\\(\\mu\\) = 0, \\(\\sigma\\) = 3): same mean, larger standard deviation Distribution 3 (\\(\\mu\\) = 6, \\(\\sigma\\) = 2): larger mean, larger standard deviation Distribution 4 (\\(\\mu\\) = -6, \\(\\sigma\\) = 0.5): smaller mean, smaller standard deviation Statements a. and c. are correct. 5.2.4 Quantifying confidence with bootstrapping Bootstrapping is an elegant way to obtain measures of confidence for summary statistics. These measures of confidence can be used for parameter inference, too. We will discuss parameter inference at length in Section ??. In this course, we will not use bootstrapping as an alternative approach to parameter inference. We will, however, follow a common practice (at least in some areas of Cognitive Psychology) to use bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the mean as part of descriptive statistics, i.e., in summaries and plots of the data. The bootstrap is a method from a more general class of algorithms, namely so-called resampling methods. The general idea is, roughly put, that we treat the data at hand as the true representation of reality. We then imagine that we run an experiment on that (restricted, hypothetical) reality. We then ask ourselves: What would we estimate (e.g., as a mean) in any such hypothetical experiment? The more these hypothetical measures derived from hypothetical experiments based on a hypothetical reality differ, the less confident we are in the estimate. Sounds weird, but it’s mind-blowingly elegant. An algorithm for constructing a 95% confidence interval of the mean of vector \\(D\\) of numeric data with length \\(k\\) looks as follows: take \\(k\\) samples from \\(D\\) with replacement, call this \\(D^{\\textrm{rep}}\\)19 calculate the mean \\(\\mu(D^{\\textrm{rep}})\\) of the newly sampled data repeat steps 1 and 2 to gather \\(r\\) means of different resamples of \\(D\\); call the result vector \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{sampled}}\\) the boundaries of the 95% inner quantile of \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{sampled}}\\) are the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval of the mean The higher \\(r\\), i.e., the more samples we take, the better the estimate. The higher \\(k\\), i.e., the more observations we have to begin with, the less variable the means \\(\\mu(D^{\\textrm{rep}})\\) of the resampled data will usually be. Hence, usually, the higher \\(k\\), the smaller the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval of the mean. Here is a convenience function that we will use throughout the book to produce bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the mean: ## takes a vector of numbers and returns bootstrapped 95% ConfInt ## of the mean, based on `n_resamples` re-samples (default: 1000) bootstrapped_CI &lt;- function(data_vector, n_resamples = 1000) { resampled_means &lt;- map_dbl(1:n_resamples, function(i) { mean(sample(x = data_vector, size = length(data_vector), replace = T) ) } ) tibble( &#39;lower&#39; = quantile(resampled_means, 0.025), &#39;mean&#39; = mean(data_vector), &#39;upper&#39; = quantile(resampled_means, 0.975) ) } Applying this method to the vector of average avocado prices, we get: bootstrapped_CI(avocado_data$average_price) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## lower mean upper ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1.40 1.41 1.41 Notice that, since average_price has length 18249, i.e., we have \\(k = 18249\\) observations in the data, the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval is rather narrow. Compare this against a case of \\(k = 300\\), obtained by only looking at the first 300 entries in average_price: # first 300 observations of `average price` only smaller_data &lt;- avocado_data$average_price[1:300] bootstrapped_CI(smaller_data) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## lower mean upper ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1.14 1.16 1.17 The mean is different (because we are looking at earlier time points) but, importantly, the interval is larger because with only 300 observations, we have less confidence in the estimate. Exercise E.3: Bootstrapping and Confidence Intervals Explain in your own words, how the bootstrapping-algorithm to obtain the 95% confidence interval of the mean works (2-3 sentences). Decide for the following statements whether they are true or false: The more samples we take from our data, the larger the 95% confidence interval gets. A larger 95% confidence interval of the mean indicates higher uncertainty regarding the mean. The 95% confidence interval of the mean contains 95% of the values of \\(\\mu_{sampled}\\). Solution To get the 95% CI of the mean, we repeatedly take samples from a data vector (with replacement) and calculate the mean of each sample. After taking \\(k\\) samples and calculating each mean \\(\\mu\\), we get a vector of means \\(\\mu_{sampled}\\). The 95% CI ranges between the boundaries of the 95% inner quantile of \\(\\mu_{sampled}\\). Statements b. and c. are correct. 5.2.4.1 Excursion: Summary functions with multiple outputs, using nested tibbles To obtain summary statistics for different groups of a variable, we can use the function bootstrapped_CI conveniently in concert with nested tibbles, as demonstrated here: avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% # nest all columns except grouping-column &#39;type&#39; in a tibble # the name of the new column is &#39;price_tibbles&#39; nest(.key = &quot;price_tibbles&quot;) %&gt;% # collect the summary statistics for each nested tibble # the outcome is a new column with nested tibbles summarise( CIs = map(price_tibbles, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$average_price)) ) %&gt;% # unnest the newly created nested tibble unnest(CIs) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## type lower mean upper ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 conventional 1.15 1.16 1.16 ## 2 organic 1.65 1.65 1.66 Using nesting in this case is helpful because we only want to run the bootstrap function once, but we need both of the numbers it returns. The following explains nesting based on this example. To understand what is going on with nested tibbles, notice that the nest function in this example creates a nested tibble with just two rows, one for each value of the variable type, each of which contains a tibble that contains all the data. The column price_tibbles in the first row contains the whole data for all observations for conventional avocados: avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% # nest all columns except grouping-column &#39;type&#39; in a tibble # the name of the new column is &#39;price_tibbles&#39; nest(.key = &quot;price_tibbles&quot;) %&gt;% # extract new column with tibble pull(price_tibbles) %&gt;% # peak at the first entry in this vector .[1] %&gt;% head() ## [[1]] ## # A tibble: 9,126 x 6 ## Date average_price total_volume_sold small medium large ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2015-12-27 1.33 64237. 1037. 54455. 48.2 ## 2 2015-12-20 1.35 54877. 674. 44639. 58.3 ## 3 2015-12-13 0.93 118220. 795. 109150. 130. ## 4 2015-12-06 1.08 78992. 1132 71976. 72.6 ## 5 2015-11-29 1.28 51040. 941. 43838. 75.8 ## 6 2015-11-22 1.26 55980. 1184. 48068. 43.6 ## 7 2015-11-15 0.99 83454. 1369. 73673. 93.3 ## 8 2015-11-08 0.98 109428. 704. 101815. 80 ## 9 2015-11-01 1.02 99811. 1022. 87316. 85.3 ## 10 2015-10-25 1.07 74339. 842. 64757. 113 ## # … with 9,116 more rows After nesting, we call the custom function bootstrapped_CI on the variable average_price inside of every nested tibble, so first for the conventional, then the organic avocados. The result is a nested tibble. If we now look inside the new column CI, we see that its cells contain tibbles with the output of each call of bootstrapped_CI: avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% # nest all columns except grouping-column &#39;type&#39; in a tibble # the name of the new column is &#39;price_tibbles&#39; nest(.key = &quot;price_tibbles&quot;) %&gt;% # collect the summary statistics for each nested tibble # the outcome is a new column with nested tibbles summarise( CIs = map(price_tibbles, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$average_price)) ) %&gt;% # extract new column vector with nested tibbles pull(CIs) %&gt;% # peak at the first entry .[1] %&gt;% head() ## [[1]] ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## lower mean upper ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1.15 1.16 1.16 Finally, we unnest the new column CIs to obtain the final result (code repeated from above): avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% # nest all columns except grouping-column &#39;type&#39; in a tibble # the name of the new column is &#39;price_tibbles&#39; nest(.key = &quot;price_tibbles&quot;) %&gt;% # collect the summary statistics for each nested tibble # the outcome is a new column with nested tibbles summarise( CIs = map(price_tibbles, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$average_price)) ) %&gt;% # unnest the newly created nested tibble unnest(CIs) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## type lower mean upper ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 conventional 1.15 1.16 1.16 ## 2 organic 1.65 1.65 1.66 For the current purpose, it is not important what a biased or unbiased estimator is and why this subtle change in the formula matters. We will come back to the issue of estimation in Chapter ??.↩ \\(D^{\\textrm{rep}}\\) is short for “repeated data”. We will use this concept more later on. The idea is that we consider “hypothetical data” which we have not perceived, but which we might have. Repeated data is (usually) of the same shape and form as the original, observed data, which is also sometimes noted as \\(D^{\\textrm{obs}}\\) for clarity in comparison to \\(D^{\\textrm{rep}}\\).↩ "],["Chap-02-03-summary-statistics-2D.html", "5.3 Covariance and correlation", " 5.3 Covariance and correlation 5.3.1 Covariance Let \\(\\vec{x}\\) and \\(\\vec{y}\\) be two vectors of numeric data of the same length, such that all pairs of \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) are associated observations. For example: the vectors avocado_data$total_volume_sold and avocado_data$average_price would be such vectors. The covariance between \\(\\vec{x}\\) and \\(\\vec{y}\\) measures, intuitively put, the degree to which changes in one vector correspond with changes in the other. Formally, covariance is defined as follows (notice that we use \\(n-1\\) in the denominator to obtain an unbiased estimator if the means are unknown): \\[\\text{Cov}(\\vec{x},\\vec{y}) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\ \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu_{\\vec{x}}) \\ (y_i - \\mu_{\\vec{y}})\\] There is a visually intuitive geometric interpretation of covariance. To see this, let’s look at a short contrived example. contrived_example &lt;- tribble( ~x, ~y, 2, 2, 2.5, 4, 3.5, 2.5, 4, 3.5 ) First, notice that the mean of x and y is 3: means_contr_example &lt;- map_df(contrived_example, mean) means_contr_example ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## x y ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 3 We can then compute the covariance as follows: contrived_example &lt;- contrived_example %&gt;% mutate( area_rectangle = (x-mean(x)) * (y - mean(y)), covariance = 1/ (n()-1) * sum((x-mean(x)) * (y - mean(y))) ) contrived_example ## # A tibble: 4 x 4 ## x y area_rectangle covariance ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2 2 1 0.25 ## 2 2.5 4 -0.5 0.25 ## 3 3.5 2.5 -0.25 0.25 ## 4 4 3.5 0.5 0.25 Similar to what we did with the variance, we can give a geometrical interpretation of covariance. Figure 5.4 shows the four summands contributing to the covariance of the contrived_example. What this graph clearly shows is that summands can have different signs. If \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) are both bigger than the mean, or if both are smaller than the mean, then the corresponding summand is positive. Otherwise, the corresponding summand is negative. This means that the covariance captures the degree to which pairs of \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) tend to deviate from the mean in the same general direction. A positive covariance is indicative of a positive general association between \\(\\vec{x}\\) and \\(\\vec{y}\\), while a negative covariance suggests that as you increase \\(x_i\\), the associated \\(y_i\\) becomes smaller. Figure 5.4: Geometrical interpretation of covariance. Four data points (orange dots) and their mean (white dot) are shown, together with the squares whose sides are the differences between the observed data points and the mean. The numbers in white give the area of each square, which is also indicated by the coloring of each rectangle. We can, of course, also calculate the covariance just with the built-in base R function cov: with(contrived_example, cov(x,y)) ## [1] 0.25 And, using this function, we can calculate the covariance between total_volume_sold and average_price in the avocado data: with(avocado_data, cov(log(total_volume_sold), average_price)) ## [1] -0.5388084 Interestingly, the negative covariance in this example suggests that across all associated data pairs, the larger total_volume_sold, the lower average_price. It is important that this is a descriptive statistics, and that this is not to be interpreted as evidence or causal relation between the two measures of interest. Not in this example, not in any other. The covariance describes associated data points; it is not evidence for causal relationships. 5.3.2 Correlation The problem with covariance is that it is not invariant under linear transformation. Consider the contrived_example from above once more. The original data had the following covariance: with(contrived_example, cov(x,y)) ## [1] 0.25 But if we just linearly transform, say, vector y to 1000 * y + 500 (e.g., because we switch to an equivalent, but numerically different measuring scale), we obtain: with(contrived_example, cov(x,1000 * y + 500)) ## [1] 250 To compensate for this problem, we can look at Bravais-Pearson correlation, which is covariance standardized by standard deviations: \\[r_{\\vec{x}\\vec{y}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(\\vec{x}, \\vec{y})}{\\text{SD}(\\vec{x}) \\ \\text{SD}(\\vec{y})}\\] Let’s check invariance under linear transformation, using the built-in function cor. The correlation coefficient for the original data is: with(contrived_example, cor(x,y)) ## [1] 0.3 The correlation coefficient for the data with linearly transformed y is: with(contrived_example, cor(x,1000 * y + 500)) ## [1] 0.3 Indeed, the correlation coefficient is nicely bounded to lie between -1 and 1. A correlation coefficient of 0 is to be interpreted as the absence of any correlation. A correlation coefficient of 1 is a perfect positive correlation (the higher \\(x_i\\), the higher \\(y_i\\)), and -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (the higher \\(x_i\\), the lower \\(y_i\\)). Again, pronounced positive or negative correlations are not to be confused with strong evidence for a causal relation. It is just a descriptive statistic on the properties of associated measurements. In the avocado data, the logarithm of total_volume_sold shows a noteworthy correlation with average_price. This is also visible in Figure 5.5. with(avocado_data, cor(log(total_volume_sold), average_price)) ## [1] -0.5834087 Figure 5.5: Scatter plot of avocado prices, plotted against (logarithms of) the total amount sold. The black line is a linear regression line indicating the (negative) correlation between these measures (more on this later). Exercise E.4: Covariance and Correlation Given two vectors of paired metric measurements \\(\\vec{x}\\) and \\(\\vec{y}\\), you are given the covariance \\(Cov(\\vec{x},\\vec{y})\\) = 1 and the variance of each vector \\(Var(\\vec{x})\\) = 25 and \\(Var(\\vec{y})\\) = 36. Compute Pearson’s correlation coefficient for \\(\\vec{x}\\) and \\(\\vec{y}\\). Decide for the following statements whether they are true or false: The covariance is bounded between -100 and 100. The Pearson correlation coefficient is bounded between 0 and 1. For any (non-trivial) vector \\(\\vec{x}\\) of metric measurements, \\(Cor(\\vec{x},\\vec{x})\\) = 1. Solution \\(r_{\\vec{x}\\vec{y}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{25}\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{1}{30}\\) Statement c. is correct. "],["Chap-02-02-visualization.html", "6 Data Visualization", " 6 Data Visualization Numerical summaries of complex data always incur information loss. Still lossy, but less so (if done well), is visualization. Any serious data analysis should start with a process in which the analyst becomes intimate with the data at hand. Visualization is an integral part of data-intimacy. Section 6.1 demonstrates how summary statistics can be misleading and how a simple visualization can be much more revealing. Section 6.2 offers some reflection on what makes a data visualization successful. Section 6.3 introduces the basics of data visualization with the ggplot package, an integral part of the tidyverse, based on a scatter plot for the avocado price data. Going beyond scatter plots, section 6.4 looks at some common types of plots and how to realize them using the geom_ family of functions in ggplot. The learning goals for this chapter are: obtain a basic understanding of better/worse plotting understand the idea of hypothesis-driven visualization develop a basic understanding of the ‘grammar of graphs’ get familiar with frequent visualization strategies barplots, densities, violins, error bars etc. be able to fine-tune graphs for better visualization "],["Chap-02-04-Anscombe-example.html", "6.1 Motivating example: Anscombe’s quartet", " 6.1 Motivating example: Anscombe’s quartet To see how summary statistics can be highly misleading, and how a simple plot can reveal a lot more, consider a famous dataset available in R (Anscombe 1973): glimpse(anscombe %&gt;% as_tibble) ## Rows: 11 ## Columns: 8 ## $ x1 &lt;dbl&gt; 10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 14, 6, 4, 12, 7, 5 ## $ x2 &lt;dbl&gt; 10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 14, 6, 4, 12, 7, 5 ## $ x3 &lt;dbl&gt; 10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 14, 6, 4, 12, 7, 5 ## $ x4 &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 19, 8, 8, 8 ## $ y1 &lt;dbl&gt; 8.04, 6.95, 7.58, 8.81, 8.33, 9.96, 7.24, 4.26, 10.84, 4.82, 5.68 ## $ y2 &lt;dbl&gt; 9.14, 8.14, 8.74, 8.77, 9.26, 8.10, 6.13, 3.10, 9.13, 7.26, 4.74 ## $ y3 &lt;dbl&gt; 7.46, 6.77, 12.74, 7.11, 7.81, 8.84, 6.08, 5.39, 8.15, 6.42, 5.73 ## $ y4 &lt;dbl&gt; 6.58, 5.76, 7.71, 8.84, 8.47, 7.04, 5.25, 12.50, 5.56, 7.91, 6.89 There are four pairs of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates.

References "],["Chap-02-04-good-visualization.html", "6.2 Visualization: the good, the bad and the info-graphic", " 6.2 Visualization: the good, the bad and the info-graphic Producing good data visualization is very difficult. There are no uncontroversial criteria for what a good visualization should be. There are, unfortunately, quite clear examples of really bad visualizations. We will look at some of these examples in the following. An absolute classic on data visualization is an early book by Edward Tufte (1983) entitled “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information”. A distilled and over-simplified summary of Tufte’s proposal is that we should eliminate chart junk and increase the data-ink ratio, a concept which Tufte defines formally. The more information (=data) a plot conveys, the higher the data-ink ratio. The more ink it requires, the lower it is. However, not all information in the data is equally relevant. Also, spending extra ink to reduce the recipients mental effort of retrieving the relevant information can be justified. Essentially, I would here propose to consider a special case of data visualization, common to scientific presentations. I want to speak of hypothesis-driven visualization as a way of communicating a clear message, the message we care most about at the current moment of (scientific) exchange. Though merely a special instance of all the goals one could pursue with data visualization, focusing on this special case is helpful because it allows us to formulate a (defeasible) rule of thumb for good visualization in analogy to how natural language ought to be used in order to achieve optimal cooperative information flow (at least as conceived by authors such as …) The vague &amp; defeasible rule of thumb of good data visualization (according to the author). “Communicate a maximal degree of relevant true information in a way that minimizes the recipient’s effort of retrieving this information.” Interestingly, just like natural language also needs to rely on a conventional medium for expressing ideas which might put additional constraints on what counts as optimal communication (e.g., we might not be allowed to drop a pronoun in English even though it is clearly recoverable from the context, and Italian speakers would happily omit it), so do certain unarticulated conventions in each specific scientific field.21 Here are a few examples of bad plotting.22 To begin with, check out this fictitious data set: large_contrast_data &lt;- tribble( ~group, ~treatment, ~measurement, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, 1000, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, 1002, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, 992, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, 990 ) If we are interested in any potential influence of variables group and treatment on the measurement in question, the following graph is ruinously unhelpful because the large size of the bars renders the relativly small differences between them almost entirely unspottable. large_contrast_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = group, y = measurement, fill = treatment)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) A better visualization would be this: large_contrast_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes( x = group, y = measurement, shape = treatment, color = treatment, group = treatment ) ) + geom_point() + geom_line() + scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) The following examples use the Bio-Logic Jazz-Metal data set, in particular the following derived table of counts or the derived table of proportions: BLJM_associated_counts ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## JM LB n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Jazz Biology 38 ## 2 Jazz Logic 26 ## 3 Metal Biology 20 ## 4 Metal Logic 18 It is probably hard to believe but Figure 6.2 was obtained without further intentional uglification just by choosing a default 3D bar plot display in Microsoft’s Excel. It does actually show the relevant information but it is entirely useless for a human observer without a magnifying glass, professional measuring tools and a calculator. Figure 6.2: Example of a frontrunner for the prize of today’s most complete disaster in the visual communication of information. It gets slightly better with the following pie chart of the same numerical information, also generated with Microsoft’s Excel. Subjectively, Figure 6.3 is pretty much anything but pretty. Objectively, it is better than the previous visualization in terms of 3D bar plots shown in Figure 6.2 but the pie chart is still not useful for answering the question which we care about, namely whether logicians are more likely to prefer Jazz over Metal than biologists. Figure 6.3: Example of a rather unhelpful visual representation of the BLJM data (when the research question is whether logicians are more likely to prefer Jazz over Metal than biologists). We can produce a much more useful representation with the code below. (A similar visualization also appeared as Figure 5.1 in the previous chapter.) BLJM_associated_counts %&gt;% ggplot( aes( x = LB, y = n, color = JM, shape = JM, group = JM ) ) + geom_point(size = 3) + geom_line() + labs( title = &quot;Counts of choices of each music+subject pair&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot; ) Info-Graphics. Scientific communication with visualized data is different from other modes of communcation with visualized data. These other contexts come with different requirements for good data visualization. Good examples of highly successful info-graphics are produced by the famous illustrator Nigel Holmes, for instance. Figure 6.4 is an example from Holmes’ website showing different amounts of energy consumption for different household appliances. The purpose of this visualization is not (only) to communicate information about which of the listed household appliances is most energy intensive. It’s main purpose is to raise awareness for the unexpectedly large energy consumption of housefold appliances in general (in stand-by mode).23 Figure 6.4: Example of an infographic. While possibly considered ‘chart junk’ in a scientific context, the eye-catching and highly memorable (and pretty!) artwork serves a strong secondary purpose in contexts other than scientific ones where hypothesis-driven precise communication with visually presented data is key. References "],["Chap-02-04-ggplot.html", "6.3 Basics of ggplot", " 6.3 Basics of ggplot In this section we will work towards a first plot with ggplot. It will be a scatter plot (more on different kinds of plots in Section 6.4) for the avocado price data. Check out the ggplot cheat sheet for a quick overview of the nuts and bolts of ggplot. The following introduces the key concepts of ggplot: incremental composition: adding elements or changing attributes of a plot incrementally convenience functions &amp; defaults: a closer look at high-level convenience functions (like geom_point) and what they actually do layers: seeing how layers are stacked when we call, e.g. different geom_ functions in sequence grouping: what happens when we use grouping information (e.g., for color, shape or in facets) The section finishes with a first full example of plot that has different layers, uses grouping, and customizes a few other things. 6.3.1 Incrementally composition of a plot The “gg” in the package name ggplot is short for “grammar of graphs”. It provides functions for describing scientific data plots in a compositional manner, i.e., for dealing with different recurrent elements in a plot in an additive way. As a results of this approach, we will use the symbol + to add more and more elements (or to override the implicit defaults in previously evoked elements) to build a plot. For example, we can obtain a scatter plot for the avocado price data simply by first calling the function ggplot, which just creates an empty plot: incrementally_built_plot &lt;- ggplot() The plot stored in variable incrementally_built_plot is very boring. Take a look: incrementally_built_plot As you can see, you do not see anything except a (white) canvas. But we can add some stuff. Don’t get hung up on the details right now, just notice that we use + to add stuff to our plot:24 incrementally_built_plot + # add a geom of type `point` (=&gt; scatter plot) geom_point( # what data to use data = avocado_data, # supply a mapping (in the form of an &#39;aesthetic&#39; (see below)) mapping = aes( # which variable to map onto the x-axis x = total_volume_sold, # which variable to map onto the y-axis y = average_price ) ) You see that the function geom_point is what makes the points appear. You tell it which data to use and which mapping of variables from the data set to elements in the plot you like. That’s it, at least to begin with. We can also supply the information about the data to use and the aesthetic mapping in the call to function ggplot. Doing so will make this information the default for any subsequently added layer. Notice also that the data argument in function ggplot is the first argument, so we will frequently make use of piping, like in the following code which is equivalent to the previous in terms of output: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price)) + geom_point() 6.3.2 Elements in the layered grammar of graphs Let’s take a step back. Actually, the function geom_point is a convenience function that does a lot of things automatically for us. It helps understanding subsequent code if we peak under the hood at least for a brief moment initially, if only to just realize where some of the terminology in and round the “grammar of graphs” comes from. The ggplot package defines a layered grammar of graphs (Wickham 2010). This is a structured description language for plots (relevant for data science). It uses a smart system of defaults so that it suffices to often just call a convenience wrapper like geom_point. But underneath there is the possibility of tinkering with (almost?) all of the (layered) elements and to change the defaults if need be. The process of mapping data onto a visualization essentially follows this route: data -&gt; statistical transformation -&gt; geom. object -&gt; aesthetics You supply (tidy) data. The data is then transformed (e.g., by computing a summary statistic) in some way or another. This could just be an “identity map” in which case you will visualize the data exactly as it is. The resulting data representation is mapped onto some spatial (geometric) appearance, like a line, a dot, or a geometric shape. Finally, there is room to alter the specific aesthetics of this mapping from data to visual object, like adjusting the size or the color of a geometric object, possibly depending on some other properties it has (e.g., whether it is an observation for a conventional or an organically grown avocado). To make explicit the steps which are implicitly carried out by geom_points in the example above, here is a fully verbose but output-equivalent sequence of commands that builds the same plot by defining all the basic components manually: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot() + # plot consists of layers (more on this soon) layer( # how to map columns onto ingredients in the plot mapping = aes(x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price), # what statistical transformation should be used? - here: none stat = &quot;identity&quot;, # how should the transformed data be visually represented? - here: as points geom = &quot;point&quot;, # should we tinker in any other way with the positioning of each element? # - here: no, thank you! position = &quot;identity&quot; ) + # x &amp; y axes are non-transformed continuous scale_x_continuous() + scale_y_continuous() + # we use a cartesian coordinate system (not a polar or a geographical map) coord_cartesian() In this explicit call, we still need to specify the data and the mapping (which variable to map onto which axis). But we need to specify much more. We tell ggplot that we want standard (e.g., not log-transformed axis). We also tell it that our axis are continuous, that the data should not be transformed and that the visual shape (=geom) to which the data is to be mapped is a point (hence the name geom_point). It is not important to understand all of these components right now. It is important to have seen them once, and to understand that geom_point is a wrapper around this call which assumes reasonable defaults (such as non-transformed axis, points for representation etc.). 6.3.3 Layers and groups ggplot is the “grammar of layered graphs”. Plots are compositionally built by combining different layers, if need be. For example, we can use another function from the geom_ family of functions to display a different visualization derived from the same data on top of our previous scatter plot.25 avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( # notice that we use the log (try without it to understand why) x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price ) ) + # add a scatter plot geom_point() + # add a linear regression line geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) Notice that layering is really sequential. To see this, just check what happens when we reverse the calls of the geom_ functions in the previous example: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( # notice that we use the log (try without it to understand why) x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price ) ) + # FIRST: add a linear regression line geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) + # THEN: add a scatter plot geom_point() If you want lower layers to be visible behind layers added later, one possibility is to tinker with opacity, via the alpha parameter. Notice that the example below also changes the colors. The result is quite toxic, but at least you see the line underneath the semi-transparent points. avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( # notice that we use the log (try without it to understand why) x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price ) ) + # FIRST: add a linear regression line geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;darkgreen&quot;) + # THEN: add a scatter plot geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = &quot;orange&quot;) The aesthetics defined in the initial call to ggplot are global defaults for all layers to follow, unless they are overwritten. This also holds for the data supplied to ggplot. For example, we can create a second layer using another call to geom_point from a second data set (e.g., with a summary statistic), like so: # create a small tibble with the means of both # variables of interest avocado_data_means &lt;- avocado_data %&gt;% summarize( mean_volume = mean(log(total_volume_sold)), mean_price = mean(average_price) ) avocado_data_means ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## mean_volume mean_price ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 11.3 1.41 avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( aes(x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price) ) + # first layer uses globally declared data &amp; mapping geom_point() + # second layer uses different data set &amp; mapping geom_point( data = avocado_data_means, mapping = aes( x = mean_volume, y = mean_price ), # change shape of element to display (see below) shape = 9, # change size of element to display size = 12, color = &quot;skyblue&quot; ) 6.3.4 Grouping Categorical distinction are frequently important in data analysis. Just think of the different combinations of factor levels in a factorial design, or the difference between conventionally grown and organically grown avocados. ggplot understands grouping very well and acts on appropriately, if you tell it to in the right way. Grouping can be relevant for different aspects of a plot: the color of points or lines, their shape, or even whether to plot everything together or separately. For instance, we might want to display different types of avocados in different color. We can do this like so: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, # use a different color for each type of avocado color = type ) ) + geom_point(aes(color = type)) Notice that we added the grouping information inside of aes to the call of ggplot. This way the grouping is the global defaul for the whole plot. Check what happens when we then add another layer, like geom_smooth: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, # use a different color for each type of avocado color = type ) ) + geom_point(aes(color = type)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) The regression lines will also be shown in the colors of the underlying scatter plot. We can change this by overwriting the color attribute locally, but then we loose the grouping information: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, # use a different color for each type of avocado color = type ) ) + geom_point(aes(color = type)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) To retrieve the grouping information, we can change the explicit keyword group (which just treats data from the relevant factor levels differently without directly changing their appearance): avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, # use a different color for each type of avocado color = type ) ) + geom_point(aes(color = type)) + geom_smooth( # tell the smoother to deal with avocados types separately aes(group = type), method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) Finally, we see that the lines are not uniquely associable with the avocado type, so we can also change the regression line’s shape attribute conditional on avocado type: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, # use a different color for each type of avocado color = type ) ) + geom_point(aes(color = type)) + geom_smooth( # tell the smoother to deal with avocados types separately aes(group = type, linetype = type), method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) 6.3.5 Example of a customized plot If done with the proper mind and heart, plots intended to share (and to communicate a point, following the idea of hypothesis-driven visualization) will usually require a lot of tweaking. We will cover some of the most frequently relevant tweaks in Section 6.6. To nevertheless get a feeling of where the journey is going, at least roughly, here is an example of a plot of the avocado data which is much more tweaked and honed. No claim is intended regarding the false idea that this plot is in any sense optimal. There is not even a clear hypothesis or point to communicate. This just showcases some functionality. Notice, for instance, that this plot uses two layers, invoked by geom_point which shows the scatter plot of points and geom_smooth which layers on top the point cloud regression lines (one for each level in the grouping variable). # pipe data set into function `ggplot` avocado_data %&gt;% # reverse factor level so that horizontal legend entries align with # the majority of observations of each group in the plot mutate( type = fct_rev(type) ) %&gt;% # initialize the plot ggplot( # defined mapping mapping = aes( # which variable goes on the x-axis x = total_volume_sold, # which variable goes on the y-axis y = average_price, # which groups of variables to distinguish group = type, # color and fill to change by grouping variable fill = type, linetype = type, color = type ) ) + # declare that we want a scatter plot geom_point( # set low opacity for each point alpha = 0.1 ) + # add a linear model fit (for each group) geom_smooth( color = &quot;black&quot;, method = &quot;lm&quot; ) + # change the default (normal) of x-axis to log-scale scale_x_log10() + # add dollar signs to y-axis labels scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + # change axis labels and plot title &amp; subtitle labs( x = &#39;Total volume sold (on a log scale)&#39;, y = &#39;Average price&#39;, title = &quot;Avocado prices against amount sold&quot;, subtitle = &quot;With linear regression lines&quot; ) Exercise E.1: Some algebra Determine which graph was created with which code: Code 1: code_1 &lt;- ggplot(avocado_data, mapping = aes( x = average_price, y = log(total_volume_sold), color = type ) ) + geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) Code 2: code_2 &lt;-ggplot(avocado_data, mapping = aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, color = type ) ) + geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) Code 3: code_3 &lt;- ggplot(avocado_data, mapping = aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price ) ) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = &quot;blue&quot;)+ labs( x = &#39;Total volume sold (on a log scale)&#39;, y = &#39;Average price&#39;, title = &quot;Avocado prices against amount sold&quot; ) Code 4: code_4 &lt;- ggplot(avocado_data, mapping = aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, linetype = type ) ) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = &quot;blue&quot;)+ labs( x = &#39;Total volume sold (on a log scale)&#39;, y = &#39;Average price&#39;, title = &quot;Avocado prices against amount sold&quot; ) Plot 1: Plot 2: Plot 3: Solution Plot 1: Code 4 Plot 2: Code 1 Plot 3: Code 2 References "],["Chap-02-04-geoms.html", "6.4 A rendezvous with popular geoms", " 6.4 A rendezvous with popular geoms In the following we will cover some of the more basic geom_ functions relevant for our present purposes. It might be useful to read this section top-to-bottom at least once, not to think of it as a mere reference list. More information is provided by the ggplot cheat sheet. 6.4.1 Scatter plots with geom_point Scatter plots visualize pairs of associated observations as points in space. We have seen this for the avocado prize data above. Let’s look at some of the further arguments we can use to tweak the presentation by geom_point. The following example changes the shape of the objects displayed to tilted rectangles (sometimes called diamonds, e.g., in LaTeX \\diamond) away from the default circles, the color of the shapes, their size and opacity. avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price)) + geom_point( # shape to display is number 23 (tilted rectangle, see below) shape = 23, # color of the surrounding line of the shape (for shapes 21-24) color = &quot;darkblue&quot;, # color of the interior of each shape fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;, # size of each shape (default is 1) size = 5, # level of opacity for each shape alpha = 0.3 ) How do you know which shape is which number? - By looking at the picture in Figure 6.5, for instance. Figure 6.5: The numerical coding of different shapes in ggplot Notice that objects 21-24 are sensitive to both color and fill, but the others are only sensitive to color. 6.4.2 Smooth The geom_smooth function operates on two-dimensional metric data and outputs a smoothed line, using different kinds of fitting functions. It is possible to show an indicator of certainty for the fit. We will deal with model fits in later parts of the book. For illustration just enjoy a few examples here: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price)) + geom_point( shape = 23, color = &quot;darkblue&quot;, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;, size = 3, alpha = 0.3 ) + geom_smooth( # fitting a smoothed curve to the data method = &quot;loess&quot;, # display standard error around smoothing curve se = T, color = &quot;darkorange&quot; ) 6.4.3 Line Use geom_line to display a line for your data if that data has associated (ordered) metrix values. You can use argument linetype to specify the kind of line to draw. tibble( x = seq(-4,8, by = 2), y = x^2 ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x,y)) + geom_line( linetype = &quot;dashed&quot; ) Sometimes you may want to draw lines between items that are grouped: BLJM_associated_counts %&gt;% ggplot( aes( x = LB, y = n, color = JM, group = JM ) ) + geom_line(size = 3) 6.4.4 Barplot A barplot, plotted with geom_bar or geom_col, displays a single number for each of several groups for visual comparison by length. The difference between these two functions is that geom_bar relies on an implicit counting, while geom_col expects the numbers that translate into the length of the bars to be supplied for it. This book favors the use of geom_col by first wrangling the data to show the numbers to be visualized, since often this is the cleaner approach and the numbers are useful to have access to independently (e.g., for referring to in the text). Here’s an example of how bar_plot works (implicitly counting numbers of occurrences): tibble( shopping_cart = c( rep(&quot;chocolate&quot;, 2), rep(&quot;ice-cream&quot;, 5), rep(&quot;cookies&quot;,8) ) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = shopping_cart)) + geom_bar() To display this data with geom_col we need to count occurrences first ourselves: tibble( shopping_cart = c( rep(&quot;chocolate&quot;, 2), rep(&quot;ice-cream&quot;, 5), rep(&quot;cookies&quot;,8) ) ) %&gt;% dplyr::count(shopping_cart) %&gt;% ggplot(aes (x = shopping_cart, y = n) ) + geom_col() To be clear, geom_col is essentially geom_bar when we overwrite the default statistical transformation of counting to “identity”: tibble( shopping_cart = c( rep(&quot;chocolate&quot;, 2), rep(&quot;ice-cream&quot;, 5), rep(&quot;cookies&quot;,8) ) ) %&gt;% dplyr::count(shopping_cart) %&gt;% ggplot(aes (x = shopping_cart, y = n) ) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) Barplots are a frequent sight in psychology papers. They are also controversial. They often fare badly with respect to the data-ink ratio. Especially, when what is plotted are means of grouped variables. For example, the following plot is rather uninformative (even if the research question is a comparison of means): avocado_data %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% summarise( mean_price = mean(average_price) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = type, y = mean_price)) + geom_col() It makes sense to use the available space for a more informative report about the distribution of data points around the means, e.g., by using geom_violin or geom_histogram etc. But barplots may also be good enough if there is not more of immediate relevance, such as when we look at counts or proportions. Still, it might help to include a measure of certainty. For instance, using the King of France data set, we can display proportions of ‘true’ answers with 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals like in the plot below. Notice the use of the geom_errorbar function to display the intervals in the following example. data_KoF_processed %&gt;% # drop unused factor levels droplevels() %&gt;% # get means and 95% bootstrapped CIs for each condition group_by(condition) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% summarise( CIs = map(data, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$response == &quot;TRUE&quot;)) ) %&gt;% unnest(CIs) %&gt;% # plot means and CIs ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = mean, fill = condition)) + geom_col() + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, width = 0.2)) + ylim(0,1) + ylab(&quot;&quot;) + xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Proportion of &#39;TRUE&#39; responses per condition&quot;) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + scale_fill_manual(values = project_colors) Exercise E.2: Create a barplot First, we need to load the data set, like so: url_prefix &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-franke/intro-data-analysis/master/data_sets/&quot; WHO_data_url &lt;- str_c(url_prefix, &quot;WHO.csv&quot;) dataWHO &lt;- read_csv(WHO_data_url) Take a look at the data set first, in order to get familiar with it. Create a bar plot, in which the Region is on the x-axis and LifeExpectancy is on the y-axis. Each bar should represent the mean value of LifeExpectancy for each Region. Solution A possible solution would be this: dataWHO %&gt;% select( Region, LifeExpectancy) %&gt;% group_by(Region) %&gt;% summarise( LifeExpectancy_mean= mean(LifeExpectancy) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes( x = Region, y = LifeExpectancy_mean, fill = Region)) + geom_col() 6.4.5 Plotting distributions: histograms, boxplots, densities and violins There are different ways for plotting the distribution of observations in a one-dimensional vector, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: the histogram, a box plot, a density plot, and a violin plot. Let’s have a look at each, based on the average_price of different types of avocados. The histogram displays the number of occurrences of observations inside of prespecified bins. By default the function geom_histogram uses 30 equally spaced bins to display counts of your observations. avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = average_price)) + geom_histogram() If we specify more bins, we get a more fine-grained picture. (But notice that such a high number of bins works for the present data set, which has many observations, but it would not necessarily for a small data set.) avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = average_price)) + geom_histogram(bins = 75) We can also layer histograms but this is usually a bad idea (even if we tinker with opacity) because a higher layer might block important information from a lower layer: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = average_price, fill = type)) + geom_histogram(bins = 75) An alternative display of distributional metric information is a box plot. Box plots are classics, also called box-and-whiskers plots, and they basically visually report key summary statistics of your metric data. These do work much better than histograms for direct comparison: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = type , y = average_price)) + geom_boxplot() What we see here is the median for each group (thick black line) and the 25% and 75% quantiles (boxes). The straight lines show the range from the 25% or 75% quantiles to the values given by median + 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n), where the IQR is the “interquartile range”, i.e., the range between the 25% and 75% quantiles (boxes). To get a better picture of the shape of the distritbuion, geom_density uses a kernel estimate to show a smoothed line, roughly indicating ranges of higher density of observations with higher numbers. Using opacity, geom_density is useful also for the close comparison of distributions across different groups: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = average_price, color = type, fill = type)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) For many groups to compare, density plots can become cluttered. Violin plots are like mirrored density plots and are better for comparison of multiple groups: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = type, y= average_price, fill = type)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) A frequently seen method of visualization is to layer a jittered distribution of points under a violin plot, like so: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = type, y= average_price, fill = type)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, width = 0.2) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) 6.4.6 Rugs Since plotting distributions, especially with high-level abstract smoothing as in geom_density and geom_violin fails to give information about the actual quantity of the data points, rug plots are useful additions to such plots. geom_rug add marks along the axes where different points lie. Here is an example of geom_rug combined with geom_density: avocado_data %&gt;% filter(type == &quot;organic&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = average_price)) + geom_density(fill = &quot;darkorange&quot;, alpha = 0.5) + geom_rug() Here are rugs on a two-dimensional scatter plot: avocado_data %&gt;% filter(type == &quot;conventional&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + geom_rug(alpha = 0.2) 6.4.7 Annotation It can be useful to add further elements to a plot. We might want to add text, or specific geometrical shapes to highlight aspects of data. The most general function for doing this is annotate. The function annotate takes as a first argument a geom argument, e.g., text or rectangle. It is therefore not a wrapper function in the geom_ family of functions, but the underlying function around which connvenience functions like geom_text or geom_rectangle are wrapped. The further arguments that annotate expects depend on the geom it is supposed to realize. Suppose we want to add textual information at a particular coordinate. We can do this with annotate as follows: avocado_data %&gt;% filter(type == &quot;conventional&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + annotate( geom = &quot;text&quot;, # x and y coordinates for the text x = 2e7, y = 2, # text to be displayed label = &quot;Bravo avocado!&quot;, color = &quot;firebrick&quot;, size = 8 ) We can also single out some data points, like so: avocado_data %&gt;% filter(type == &quot;conventional&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + annotate( geom = &quot;rect&quot;, # coordinates for the rectangle xmin = 2.1e7, xmax = max(avocado_data$total_volume_sold) + 100, ymin = 0.7, ymax = 1.7, color = &quot;firebrick&quot;, alpha = 0, size = 2 ) "],["Chap-02-04-faceting.html", "6.5 Faceting", " 6.5 Faceting If we have grouping information, sometimes it can just get too much to put all of the information in a single plot, even if we use colors, shapes or linetypes for disambiguation. Facets are a great way to seperately repeat the same kind of plot for different levels of relevant factors. The functions facet_grid and facet_wrap are used for faceting. They both expect a formula-like syntax (we have not yet introduced formulas) using the notation ~ to separate factors. The difference between these functions shows most clearly when we have more than two factors. So let’s introduce a new factor early to the avocado price data, representing whether a recorded measurement was no later than the median date or not. avocado_data_early_late &lt;- avocado_data %&gt;% mutate(early = ifelse(Date &lt;= median(Date), &quot;early&quot;, &quot;late&quot;)) Using facet_grid we get a two-dimensional grid, and we can specify along which axis of this grid the different factor levels are to range by putting the factors in the formula notation like this: row_factor ~ col_factor. avocado_data_early_late %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = &quot;skyblue&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;darkorange&quot;) + facet_grid(type ~ early) The same kind of plot realized with facet_wrap looks slightly different. The different factor level combinations are mushed together into a pair. avocado_data_early_late %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = &quot;skyblue&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;darkorange&quot;) + facet_wrap(type ~ early) Exercise E.3: Faceting In you own words, describe what each line of the both codes above do: Solution For both: 1. Defining which information should be placed on which axes. 2.A scatter plot is created using geom point to show data points. Furthermore, the alpha level is chosen and the color of the points is skyblue. 3.A line is added using geom_smooth and the method lm. The color of the line is dark orange. 4. Both geom-point and geom_smooth are currently following the mapping given at the beginning facet_grid: 5. Now the grid is created with facet_grid, which divides the plot into type and time (early or late). In each part of the plot you now see the subplot, which contains only the data points that belong to the respective combination.Type and time are placed on different axes. facet_wrap: 5. Now the grid is created with facet_grid, which divides the plot into type and time (early or late). In each part of the plot you now see the subplot, which contains only the data points that belong to the respective combination. Here type and time are combined into pairs. With facet_wrap it is possible to specify the desired number of columns or rows: avocado_data_early_late %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = &quot;skyblue&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;darkorange&quot;) + facet_wrap(type ~ early, nrow = 1) "],["Chap-02-04-customization.html", "6.6 Customization etc.", " 6.6 Customization etc. There are many ways in which graphs can (and often: ought to) be tweaked further. The following can only cover a small, but hopefully useful selection. 6.6.1 Themes The general appearance of a plot is governed by its theme. There are many ready-made themes already in the ggplot package, as listed here, and there are more in several other packages. If we store a plot in a variable we can look at how different themes affect it. avocado_grid_plot &lt;- avocado_data_early_late %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = &quot;skyblue&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;darkorange&quot;) + facet_grid(type ~ early) avocado_grid_plot + theme_classic() avocado_grid_plot + theme_void() avocado_grid_plot + theme_dark() The plots in this book use the theme hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum from the hrbrthemes package as a default. You can set the default theme for all subsequent plots using a command like this: # set the &#39;void&#39; theme as global default theme_set( theme_void() ) More elaborate tweaking of a plot’s layout can be achieved by the theme function. There are many options. Some let you do crazy things: avocado_grid_plot + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;darkgreen&quot;)) 6.6.2 Guides When using grouped variables (by color, shape, linetype, group, …) ggplot creates a legend automatically. avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, color = type ) ) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) The legend can be suppressed with the guides command. It takes as arguments the different types of grouping variables (like color, group, etc,) avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( x = log(total_volume_sold), y = average_price, color = type ) ) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + # no legend for grouping by color guides(color = &quot;none&quot;) 6.6.3 Axes, ticks and tick labels If you need to use a non-standard (Cartesian) axis, you can do so, e.g., to change the \\(x\\)-axis to a log scale (with base 10): avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price, color = type ) ) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10() The scales package has a number of nice convenience functions for tweaking axis ticks (the places where axes are marked and possibly labelled) and tick labels (the labels applied to the tick marks). For example, we can add dollar signs to the price information, like so: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price, color = type ) ) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) 6.6.4 Labels To change any other kind of labeling information (aside from tick mark labels on axes), the labs function can be used. It is rather self-explanatory: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot( mapping = aes( x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price, color = type ) ) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + # change axis labels and plot title &amp; subtitle labs( x = &#39;Total volume sold (on a log scale)&#39;, y = &#39;Average price&#39;, title = &quot;Avocado prices plotted against the amount sold per type&quot;, subtitle = &quot;With linear regression lines&quot;, caption = &quot;This plot shows the total volume of avocados sold against the average price for many different points in time.&quot; ) 6.6.5 Combining &amp; arranging plots Presenting visual information in a tightly packed spatial arrangement can be helpful for the spectator. Everything is within a single easy saccade, so to speak. Therefore it can be useful to combine different plots into a single combined plot. The cowplot package helps with this, in particular the function cowplot::plot_grid as shown here: # create an avocado plot avocado_plot &lt;- avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) # create a BLJM bar plot BLJM_plot &lt;- data_BLJM_processed %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = response)) + geom_bar() # combine both into one cowplot::plot_grid( # plots to combine avocado_plot, BLJM_plot, # number columns ncol = 1 ) 6.6.6 LaTeX expressions in plot labels If you are enthusiastic about LaTeX, you can also use it inside of plot labels. The latex2exp package is useful here, which provides the function latex2exp::TeX to allow you to include LaTeX formulas. Just make sure that you double all backslashes, as in the following example: avocado_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = total_volume_sold, y = average_price)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + labs(title = latex2exp::TeX(&quot;We can use $\\\\LaTeX$ here: $\\\\sum_{i = 0}^n \\\\alpha^i$&quot;)) Exercise E.4: Customization Feel free to play around with customising your previously created plots or plots that you find in this book. Try to make annotations or try out different themes and colours. It will help you understand these kinds of plots a little better "],["Chap-03-01-probability.html", "7 Basics of Probability Theory", " 7 Basics of Probability Theory Probability is the basic ingredient of statistical inference. In this chapter, we will cover the very basics of probability theory. We will visit its axiomatic definition and some common interpretations in Section 7.1, where we also start with the main mental exercise of this section: seeing how probability distributions can be approximately represented by samples. We will cover important concepts such as joint and marginal probability in Section 7.2. This paves the way for learning about conditional probability and Bayes rule in Section 7.3. Section 7.4 introduces the notion of a random variable. Finally, Section 7.5 briefly covers how information about common probability distributions can be accessed in R. Learning goals: become familiar with the notion of probability and also: its axiomatic definition the notion of joint, marginal and conditional probability understand and apply Bayes rule get comfortable with random variables become able to handle probability distributions in R understand how probability distributions are approximately represented by samples "],["Chap-03-01-probability-basics.html", "7.1 Probability", " 7.1 Probability 7.1.1 Outcomes, events, observations We are interested in the space \\(\\Omega\\) containing all elementary outcome \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\dots \\in \\Omega\\) of a process or an event whose execution is (partially) random or unknown. Elementary outcomes are mutually exclusive (\\(\\omega_i \\neq \\omega_j \\; \\text{for} \\,\\forall i \\neq j\\)). The set \\(\\Omega\\) exhausts all possibilities.26 Example. The set of elementary outcomes of a single coin flip is \\(\\Omega_{\\text{coin flip}} = \\left \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\right \\}\\). The elementary outcomes of tossing a six-sided die are \\(\\Omega_{\\text{standard die}} = \\{\\)⚀, ⚁, ⚂, ⚃, ⚄, ⚅ \\(\\}\\).27 An event \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(\\Omega\\). Think of an event as a (possibly partial) observation. We might observe, for instance, not the full outcome of tossing a die, but only that there is a dot in the middle. This would correspond to the event \\(A = \\{\\) ⚀, ⚂, ⚄ \\(\\}\\), i.e., observing an odd-numbered outcome. The trivial observation \\(A = \\Omega\\) and the impossible observation \\(A = \\emptyset\\) are counted as events, too. The latter is included for technical reasons that we don’t need to know for our purpose. For any two events \\(A, B \\subseteq \\Omega\\), standard set operations correspond to logical connectives in the usual way. For example, the conjunction \\(A \\cap B\\) is the observation of both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); the disjunction \\(A \\cup B\\) is the observation that it is either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\); the negation of \\(A\\), \\(\\overline{A} = \\left \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid \\omega \\not \\in A \\right \\}\\), is the observation that it is not \\(A\\). 7.1.2 Probability distributions A probability distribution \\(P\\) over \\(\\Omega\\) is a function \\(P \\ \\colon \\ \\mathfrak{P}(\\Omega) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\)28 that assigns to all events \\(A \\subseteq \\Omega\\) a real number (from the unit interval, see A1 below), such that the following (so-called Kolmogorov axioms) are satisfied: A1. \\(0 \\le P(A) \\le 1\\) A2. \\(P(\\Omega) = 1\\) A3. \\(P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup \\dots) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + \\dots\\) whenever \\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots\\) are mutually exclusive29 Occasionally we encounter notation \\(P \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)\\) to express that \\(P\\) is a probability distribution over \\(\\Omega\\). (E.g., in physics, theoretical economics or game theory. Less so in psychology or statistics.) If \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) is an elementary event, we often write \\(P(\\omega)\\) as a shorthand for \\(P(\\left \\{ \\omega \\right \\})\\). In fact, if \\(\\Omega\\) is finite, it suffices to assign probabilities to elementary outcomes. A number of rules follow immediately from the definition: C1. \\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\) C2. \\(P(\\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)\\) C3. \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\) for any \\(A, B \\subseteq \\Omega\\) 7.1.3 Interpretations of probability Preliminarily, it is reasonably safe to think of probability as defined above as a handy mathematical primitive which is useful for certain applications. There are at least three ways of thinking about where this primitive probability might come from: Frequentist: Probabilities are generalizations of intuitions/facts about frequencies of events in repeated executions of a random event. Subjectivist: Probabilities are subjective beliefs by a rational agent who is uncertain about the outcome of a random event. Realist: Probabilities are the property of an intrinsically random world. 7.1.4 Distributions as samples No matter what your metaphysics of probability are, it is useful to realize that probability distributions can be approximately represented by sampling. Think of an urn as a container with balls of different colors with different proportions (see Figure 7.1). In the simplest case, there is a number of \\(N &gt; 1\\) balls of which \\(k &gt; 0\\) are black and \\(N-k &gt; 0\\) are white. (There are at least one black and one white ball.) For a single random draw from our urn we have: \\(\\Omega_{\\text{our urn}} = \\left \\{ \\text{white}, \\text{black} \\right \\}\\). We now draw from this urn with replacement. That is, we shake the urn, draw one ball, observe its color, take note of the color, and put it back into the urn. Each ball has the same chance of being sampled. If we imagine an infinite sequence of single draws from our urn with replacement, the limiting proportion with which we draw a black ball is \\(\\frac{k}{N}\\). This statement about frequency is what motivates saying that the probability of drawing a black ball on a single trial is (or should be30) \\(P(\\text{black}) = \\frac{k}{N}\\). Figure 7.1: An urn with seven black balls and three white balls. Imagine shaking this container, and then drawing blindly a single ball from it. It every ball has an equal probability of being drawn, what is the probability of drawing a black ball? That would be 0.7. The following code demonstrates how the proportion of black balls drawn from an urn-like in Figure 7.1 with \\(k = 7\\) black balls and \\(N = 10\\) balls in total, gravitates to the probability 0.7 when we keep drawing and drawing. # urn with 7 black and 3 white balls urn &lt;- c( rep(&quot;black&quot;, 7), rep(&quot;white&quot;, 3) ) # number of samples to take n_samples &lt;- 10000 # take `n_samples` samples from the urn (with replacement) draws &lt;- sample( # vector to sample from (default probability is uniform) x = urn, # take a million samples size = n_samples, # put each ball back after drawing replace = TRUE ) # plotting the development of the proportion of &#39;black&#39; balls tibble( draw_nr = 1:n_samples, draw = draws, # relative frequency of &#39;black&#39; balls prop_black = cumsum(draw == &quot;black&quot;) / draw_nr ) %&gt;% # take only multiples of 10 draws filter(draw_nr %% 10 == 0) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = draw_nr, y = prop_black)) + geom_line(color = &quot;darkgray&quot;) + # add a red line for the true limiting probability geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0.7), color = &quot;firebrick&quot;) + labs( x = &quot;number of draws&quot;, y = &quot;proportion of &#39;black&#39; balls drawn&quot;, title = &quot;Temporal development of the proportion of draws from an urn&quot; ) To sum this up concisely, we have a random process (drawing once from the urn) whose outcome is uncertain, and we convinced ourselves that the probability of an outcome corresponds to the relative frequency it occurs, in the limit of repeatedly executing the random process (i.e., sampling from the urn). From here it requires only a small step to a crucial but ultimately very liberating realization. If the probability of an event occurring can be approximated by its frequency in a large sample, then we can represent (say: internally in a computer) a probability distribution as one of two things: a large set of (what is called: representative) samples; or even better as an oracle (e.g., in the form of a clever algorithm) which quickly returns a representative sample. This means that, for approximately computing with probability, we can represent distributions through samples or a sample-generating function. We do not need to know precise probability or be able to express them in a mathematical formula. Samples or sampling is enough to approximate probability distributions. For the simplicity of exposure, we gloss over subtleties arising when dealing with infinite sets \\(\\Omega\\). We make up for this when we define probability density functions for continuous random variables, which have an uncountably infinite number of elementary outcomes. We will usually be concerned with continuous random variables within applied statistics.↩ Think of \\(\\Omega\\) as a partition of the space of all possible ways in which the world could be, where we lump together into one partition cell (one elementary outcome) all ways in which the world could be that are equivalent regarding those aspects of reality that we are interested in. We do not care whether the coin lands in the mud or the sand. It only matters whether it came up heads or tails. Each elementary event can be realized in myriad ways. \\(\\Omega\\) is our, the modelers’, first crude simplification of nature, abstracting away aspects we currently do not care about.↩ For any of you who are interested in the precise mathematical description of probability space, \\(\\mathfrak{P}(\\Omega)\\) is called Borel set. It is important since probabilities can be only defined for measurable sets. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_set↩ A3 is the axiom of countable additivity. Finite additivity may be enough for finite or countable sets \\(\\Omega\\), but infinite additivity is necessary for full generality in the uncountable case.↩ If probabilities are subjective beliefs, a rational agent is, in a sense, normatively required to assign exactly this probability.↩ "],["Chap-03-01-probability-marginal.html", "7.2 Structured events &amp; marginal distributions", " 7.2 Structured events &amp; marginal distributions 7.2.1 Probability table for a flip-and-draw scenario Suppose we have two urns. Both have \\(N=10\\) balls. Urn 1 has \\(k_1=2\\) black and \\(N-k_1 = 8\\) white balls. Urn 2 has \\(k_2=4\\) black and \\(N-k_2=6\\) white balls. We sometimes draw from urn 1, sometimes from urn 2. To decide from which urn a ball should be drawn, we flip a fair coin. If it comes up heads, we draw from urn 1; if it comes up tails, we draw from urn 2. The process is visualized in Figure 7.2 below. An elementary outcome of this two-step process of flip-and-draw is a pair \\(\\langle \\text{outcome-flip}, \\text{outcome-draw} \\rangle\\). The set of all possible such outcomes is: \\[\\Omega_{\\text{flip-and-draw}} = \\left \\{ \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{white} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{black} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{white} \\rangle \\right \\}\\,.\\] The probability of event \\(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle\\) is given by multiplying the probability of seeing “heads” on the first flip, which happens with probability \\(0.5\\), and then drawing a black ball, which happens with probability \\(0.2\\), so that \\(P(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle) = 0.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.1\\). The probability distribution over \\(\\Omega_{\\text{flip-draw}}\\) is consequently as in Table 7.1. (If in doubt, start flipping &amp; drawing and count your outcomes.) Table 7.1: Joint probability table for the flip-and-draw scenario heads tails black \\(0.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.1\\) \\(0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.2\\) white \\(0.5 \\times 0.8 = 0.4\\) \\(0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3\\) Figure 7.2: The flip-and-draw scenario, with transition and full path probabilities. 7.2.2 Structured events and joint-probability distributions Table 7.1 is an example of a joint probability distribution over a structured event space, which here have two dimensions. Since our space of outcomes is the Cartesian product of two simpler outcome spaces, namely \\(\\Omega_{flip-\\&amp;-draw} = \\Omega_{flip} \\times \\Omega_{draw}\\),31 we can use notation \\(P(\\text{heads}, \\text{black})\\) as shorthand for \\(P(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle)\\). More generally, if \\(\\Omega = \\Omega_1 \\times \\dots \\Omega_n\\), we can think of \\(P \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)\\) as a joint probability distribution over \\(n\\) subspaces. 7.2.3 Marginalization If \\(P\\) is a joint-probability distribution over event space \\(\\Omega = \\Omega_1 \\times \\dots \\Omega_n\\), the marginal distribution over subspace \\(\\Omega_i\\), \\(1 \\le i \\le n\\) is the probability distribution that assigns to all \\(A_i \\subseteq \\Omega_i\\) the probability:32 \\[ P(A_i) = \\sum_{A_1 \\subseteq \\Omega_{1}, \\dots , A_{i-1} \\subseteq \\Omega_{i-1}, A_{i+1} \\subseteq \\Omega_{i+1}, \\dots, A_n \\subseteq \\Omega_n} P(A_1, \\dots, A_{i-1}, A_{i}, A_{i+1}, \\dots A_n) \\] For example, the marginal distribution of draws derivable from Table 7.1 has \\(P(\\text{black}) = P(\\text{heads, black}) + P(\\text{heads, white}) = 0.3\\) and \\(P(\\text{white}) = 0.7\\).33 The marginal distribution of coin flips derivable from the joint probability distribution in Table 7.1 gives \\(P(\\text{heads}) = P(\\text{tails}) = 0.5\\), since the sum of each column is exactly \\(0.5\\). With \\(\\Omega_{\\text{flip}} = \\left \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\right \\}\\) and \\(\\Omega_{\\text{draw}} = \\left \\{ \\text{black}, \\text{white} \\right \\}\\).↩ This notation, using \\(\\sum\\), assumes that subspaces are countable. In other cases, a parallel definition with integrals can be used.↩ The term ``marginal distribution’’ derives from such probability tables, where traditionally the sum of each row/column was written in the margins.↩ "],["Chap-03-01-probability-conditional.html", "7.3 Conditional probability", " 7.3 Conditional probability Let us assume probability distribution \\(P \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)\\) and events \\(A,B \\subseteq \\Omega\\) are given. The conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\), written as \\(P(A \\mid B)\\), gives the probability of \\(A\\) on the assumption that \\(B\\) is true.34 It is defined like so: \\[P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] Conditional probabilities are only defined when \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\).35 Example. If a die is unbiased, each of its six faces has equal probability to come up after a toss. The probability of event \\(B = \\{\\) ⚀, ⚂, ⚄ \\(\\}\\) that the tossed number is odd has probability \\(P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). The probability of event \\(A = \\{\\) ⚂, ⚃, ⚄, ⚅ \\(\\}\\) that the tossed number is bigger than two is \\(P(A) = \\frac{2}{3}\\). The probability that the tossed number is bigger than two odd is \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(\\{\\) ⚂, ⚄ \\(\\}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\). The conditional probability of tossing a number that is bigger than two, when we know that the toss is odd, is \\(P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{1 / 3}{1 / 2} = \\frac{2}{3}\\). Algorithmically, conditional probability first rules out all events in which \\(B\\) is not true and then simply renormalizes the probabilities assigned to the remaining events in such a way that the relative probabilities of surviving events remain unchanged. Given this, another way of interpreting conditional probability is that \\(P(A \\mid B)\\) is what a rational agent should believe about \\(A\\) after observing (nothing more than) that \\(B\\) is true. The agent rules out, possibly hypothetically, that \\(B\\) is false, but otherwise does not change opinion about the relative probabilities of anything that is compatible with \\(B\\). 7.3.1 Bayes rule Looking back at the joint-probability distribution in Table 7.1, the conditional probability \\(P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads})\\) of drawing a black ball, given that the initial coin flip showed heads, can be calculated as follows: \\[ P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads}) = \\frac{P(\\text{black} , \\text{heads})}{P(\\text{heads})} = \\frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \\] This calculation, however, is quite excessive. We can read out the conditional probability directly already from the way the flip-and-draw scenario was set up. After flipping heads, we draw from urn 1, which has \\(k=2\\) out of \\(N=10\\) black balls, so clearly: if the flip returns head, then the probability of a black ball is \\(0.2\\). Indeed, in a step-wise random generation process like the flip-and-draw scenario, some conditional probabilities are very clear, and sometimes given by definition. These are, usually, the conditional probabilities that define how the process unfolds forward in time, so to speak. Bayes rule is a way of expressing, in a manner of speaking, conditional probabilities in terms of the “reversed” conditional probabilities: \\[P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\mid B) \\times P(B)}{P(A)}\\] Bayes rule is a straightforward corollary of the definition of conditional probabilities, according to which \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) \\times P(B)\\), so that: \\[ P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} = \\frac{P(A \\mid B) \\cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \\] Bayes rule allows for reasoning backward from observed causes to likely underlying effects. When we have a feed-forward model of how unobservable effects probabilistically constrain observable outcomes, Bayes rule allows us to draw inferences about latent/unobservable variables based on the observation of their downstream effects. Consider yet again the flip-and-draw scenario. But now assume that Jones flipped the coin and drew a ball. We see that it is black. What is the probability that it was drawn from urn 1, or equivalently, that the coin landed heads? It is not \\(P(\\text{heads}) = 0.5\\), the so-called prior probability of the coin landing heads. It is a conditional probability, also called the posterior probability,36 namely \\(P(\\text{heads} \\mid \\text{black})\\). But it is not as easy and straightforward to write down as the reverse probability \\(P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads})\\) of which we said above that it is an almost trivial part of the set up of the flip-and-draw scenario. It is here that Bayes rule has its purpose: \\[ P(\\text{heads} \\mid \\text{black}) = \\frac{P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads}) \\times P(\\text{heads})}{P(\\text{black})} = \\frac{0.2 \\times 0.5}{0.3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\] This result is quite intuitive. Drawing a black ball from urn 2 (i.e. after seeing tails) is twice as likely as drawing a black ball from urn 1 (i.e. after seeing heads). Consequently, after seeing a black ball drawn, with equal probabilities of heads and tails, the probability that the coin landed tails is also twice as large as that it landed heads. Excursion: Bayes rule for data analysis In later chapters, we will use Bayes rule for data analysis. The flip-and-draw scenario structurally “preflects” what will happen later. Think of the color of the ball drawn as the data \\(D\\) which we observe. Think of the coin as a latent parameter \\(\\theta\\) of a statistical model. Bayes rule for data analysis then looks like this: \\[P(\\theta \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid \\theta) \\ P(\\theta)}{P(D)}\\] We will discuss this at length in Chapter ?? and thereafter. 7.3.2 Stochastic (in-)dependence Event \\(A\\) is stochastically independent of \\(B\\) if, intuitively speaking, learning \\(B\\) does not change one’s beliefs about \\(A\\), i.e. \\(P(A \\mid B) = P(A)\\). If \\(A\\) is stochastically independent of \\(B\\), then \\(B\\) is stochastically independent of \\(A\\) because: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P(B \\mid A) &amp; = \\frac{P(A \\mid B) \\ P(B)}{P(A)} &amp;&amp; \\text{[Bayes rule]} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(A) \\ P(B)}{P(A)} &amp;&amp; \\text{[by ass. of independence]} \\\\ &amp; = P(B) &amp;&amp; \\text{[cancellation]} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] For example, imagine a flip-and-draw scenario where the initial coin flip has a bias of \\(0.8\\) towards heads, but each of the two urns has the same number of black balls, namely \\(3\\) black and \\(7\\) white balls. Intuitively and formally, the probability of drawing a black ball is then independent of the outcome of the coin flip; learning that the coin landed heads, does not change our beliefs about how likely the subsequent draw will result in a black ball. The probability table for this example is in Table 7.2. Table 7.2: Joint probability table for a flip-and-draw scenario where the coin has a bias of \\(0.8\\) towards heads and where each of the two urns holds \\(3\\) black and \\(7\\) white balls. heads tails \\(\\Sigma\\) rows black \\(0.8 \\times 0.3 = 0.24\\) \\(0.2 \\times 0.3 = 0.06\\) 0.3 white \\(0.8 \\times 0.7 = 0.56\\) \\(0.2 \\times 0.7 = 0.14\\) 0.7 \\(\\Sigma\\) columns 0.8 0.2 1.0 Independence shows in Table 7.2 in the fact that the probability in each cell is the product of the two marginal probabilities. This is a direct consequence of stochastic independence: Proposition 7.1 (Probability of conjunction of stochastically independent events) For any pair of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) with non-zero probability: \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\ P(B) \\, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{[if } A \\text{ and } B \\text{ are stoch. independent]} \\] Proof. By assumption of independence, it holds that \\(P(A \\mid B) = P(A)\\). But then: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P(A \\cap B) &amp; = P(A \\mid B) \\ P(B) &amp;&amp; \\text{[def. of conditional probability]} \\\\ &amp; = P(A) \\ P(B) &amp;&amp; \\text{[by ass. of independence]} \\end{aligned} \\]   We also verbalize this as “the conditional probability of \\(A\\) conditioned on \\(B\\).”↩ Updating with events which have probability zero entails far more severe adjustments of the underlying belief system than just ruling out information hitherto considered possible. Formal systems that capture such belief revision are studied in formal epistemology by Halpern (2003) .↩ The terms prior and posterior make sense when we think about an agent’s belief state before (prior to) and after (posterior to) an observation.↩ "],["Chap-03-01-probability-random-variables.html", "7.4 Random variables", " 7.4 Random variables So far, we have defined a probability distribution as a function that assigns a probability to each subset of the space \\(\\Omega\\) of elementary outcomes. A special case occurs when we are interested in a space of numeric outcomes. A random variable is a function \\(X \\ \\colon \\ \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) that assigns to each elementary outcome a numerical value. It is reasonable to think of this number as a summary statistic: a number that captures one aspect of relevance of what is actually a much more complex chunk of reality. Example. For a single flip of a coin we have \\(\\Omega_{\\text{coin flip}} = \\left \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\right \\}\\). A usual way of mapping this onto numerical outcomes is to define \\(X_{\\text{coin flip}} \\ \\colon \\ \\text{heads} \\mapsto 1; \\text{tails} \\mapsto 0\\). Less trivially, consider flipping a coin two times. Elementary outcomes should be individuated by the outcome of the first flip and the outcome of the second flip, so that we get: \\[ \\Omega_{\\text{two flips}} = \\left \\{ \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{heads} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{heads} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{tails} \\rangle \\right \\} \\] Consider the random variable \\(X_{\\text{two flips}}\\) that counts the total number of heads. Crucially, \\(X_{\\text{two flips}}(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\rangle) = 1 = X_{\\text{two flips}}(\\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{heads} \\rangle)\\). We assign the same numerical value to different elementary outcomes since the order is not relevant. 7.4.1 Notation &amp; terminology Traditionally random variables are represented by capital letters, like \\(X\\). The numeric values they take on are written as small letters, like \\(x\\). We write \\(P(X = x)\\) as a shorthand for the probability \\(P(\\left \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X(\\omega) = x \\right \\})\\), that an event \\(\\omega\\) occurs which is mapped onto \\(x\\) by the random variable \\(X\\). For example, if our coin is fair, then \\(P(X_{\\text{two flips}} = x) = 0.5\\) for \\(x=1\\) and \\(0.25\\) for \\(x=0,2\\). Similarly, we can also write \\(P(X \\le x)\\) for the probability of observing an event that \\(X\\) maps to a number not bigger than \\(x\\). If the range of \\(X\\) is countable (not necessarily finite), we say that \\(X\\) is discrete. For ease of exposition, we may say that if the range of \\(X\\) is an interval of real numbers, \\(X\\) is called continuous. 7.4.2 Cumulative distribution functions, mass &amp; density For a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the cumulative distribution function \\(F_X\\) associated with \\(X\\) is defined as: \\[ F_X(x) = P(X \\le x) = \\sum_{x&#39; \\in \\left \\{ \\text{Rng}(X) \\mid x&#39; \\le x \\right \\}} P(X = x) \\] The probability mass function \\(f_x\\) associated with \\(X\\) is defined as: \\[ f_X(x) = P(X = x) \\] Example. Suppose we flip a coin with a bias of \\(\\theta\\) towards heads \\(n\\) times. What is the probability that we will see heads \\(k\\) times? If we map the outcome of heads to 1 and tails to 0, this probability is given by the Binomial distribution, as follows: \\[ \\text{Binom}(K = k ; n, \\theta) = \\binom{n}{k} \\, \\theta^{k} \\, (1-\\theta)^{n-k} \\] Here \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\) is the binomial coefficient. It gives the number of possibilities of drawing an unordered subset with \\(k\\) elements from a set with a total of \\(n\\) elements. Figure 7.3 gives an example of the Binomial distribution, concretely its probability mass function, for two values of the coin’s bias, \\(\\theta = 0.25\\) or \\(\\theta = 0.5\\), when flipping the coin \\(n=24\\) times. Figure 7.4 gives the corresponding cumulative distributions. Figure 7.3: Examples of the Binomial distribution. The \\(y\\)-axis give the probability of seeing \\(k\\) heads when flipping a coin \\(n=24\\) times with a bias of either \\(\\theta = 0.25\\) or \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). Figure 7.4: Examples of the cumulative distribution of the Binomial. The \\(y\\)-axis gives the probability of seeing \\(k\\) or fewer outcomes of heads when flipping a coin \\(n=24\\) times with a bias of either \\(\\theta = 0.25\\) or \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). For a continuous random variable \\(X\\), the probability \\(P(X = x)\\) will usually be zero: it is virtually impossible that we will see precisely the value \\(x\\) realized in a random event that can realize uncountably many numerical values of \\(X\\). However, \\(P(X \\le x)\\) does take workable values and so we define the cumulative distribution function \\(F_X\\) associated with \\(X\\) as: \\[ F_X(x) = P(X \\le x) \\] Instead of a probability mass function, we derive a probability density function from the cumulative function as: \\[ f_X(x) = F&#39;(x) \\] A probability density function can take values greater than one, unlike a probability mass function. Example. The Gaussian (Normal) distribution characterizes many natural distributions of measurements which are symmetrically spread around a central tendency. It is defined as: \\[ \\mathcal{N}(X = x ; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\sigma^2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) \\] where parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, the central tendency, and parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation. Figure 7.5 gives examples of the probability density function of two normal distributions. Figure 7.6 gives the corresponding cumulative distribution functions. Figure 7.5: Examples of the Normal distribution. In both cases \\(\\mu = 0\\), once with \\(\\sigma = 1\\) and once with \\(\\sigma = 4\\) Figure 7.6: Examples of the cumulative normal distribution corresponding to the previous probability density functions. 7.4.3 Expected value &amp; variance The expected value of a random variable \\(X\\) is a measure of central tendency. It tells us, like the name suggests, which average value of \\(X\\) we can expect when repeatedly sampling from \\(X\\). If \\(X\\) is continuous, the expected value is: \\[ \\mathbb{E}_X = \\sum_{x} x \\times f_X(x) \\] If \\(X\\) is continuous, it is: \\[ \\mathbb{E}_X = \\int x \\times f_X(x) \\ \\text{d}x \\] The expected value is also frequently called the mean. The variance of a random variable \\(X\\) is a measure of how much likely values of \\(X\\) are spread or clustered around the expected value. If \\(X\\) is discrete, the variance is: \\[ \\text{Var}(X) = \\sum_x (\\mathbb{E}_X - x)^2 \\times f_X(x) \\] If \\(X\\) is continuous, it is: \\[ \\text{Var}(X) = \\int (\\mathbb{E}_X - x)^2 \\times f_X(x) \\ \\text{d}x \\] Example. If we flip a coin with bias \\(\\theta = 0.25\\) a total of \\(n=24\\) times, we expect on average to see \\(n \\times\\theta = 24 \\times 0.25 = 6\\) outcomes showing heads.37 The variance of a binomally distributed variable is \\(n \\times\\theta \\times(1-\\theta) = 24 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.75 = \\frac{24 \\times 3}{16} = \\frac{18}{4} = 4.5\\). The expected value of a normal distribution is just its mean \\(\\mu\\) and its variance is \\(\\sigma^2\\). 7.4.4 Composite random variables Composite random variables are random variables generated by mathematical operations conjoining other random variables. For example, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are random variables, then we can define a new derived random variable \\(Z\\) using notation like: \\[Z = X + Y\\] This notation looks innocuous but is conceptually tricky yet ultimately very powerful. On the face of it, we are doing as if we are using + to add two functions. But a sampling-based perspective makes this quite intuitive. We can think of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as large samples, representing the probability distributions in question. Then we build a sample by just adding elements in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). (If samples are of different size, just add a random element of \\(Y\\) to each \\(X\\).) Consider the following concrete example. \\(X\\) is the probability distribution of rolling a fair dice with six sides. \\(Y\\) is the probability distribution of flipping a biased coin which lands heads (represented as number 1) with probability 0.75. The derived probability distribution \\(Z = X + Y\\) can be approximately represented by samples derived as follows: n_samples &lt;- 1e6 # `n_samples` rolls of a fair dice samples_x &lt;- sample( 1:6, size = n_samples, replace = T ) # `n_samples` flips of a biased coin samples_y &lt;- sample( c(0,1), prob = c(0.25, 0.75), size = n_samples, replace = T ) samples_z &lt;- samples_x + samples_y tibble(outcome = samples_z) %&gt;% dplyr::count(outcome) %&gt;% mutate(n = n/sum(n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = outcome, y = n)) + geom_col() + labs(y = &quot;proportion&quot;) This is not immediately obvious from our definition, but it is intuitive and you can derive it.↩ "],["Chap-03-01-probability-R.html", "7.5 Probability distributions in R", " 7.5 Probability distributions in R Appendix ?? covers a number of common probability distributions that are relevant for the purposes of this course. Appendix ?? furthermore provides additional theoretical background on the exponential family, an important class of probability distributions widely used in statistics. R has built-in functions for most common probability distributions. Further distributions are covered in additional packages. If mydist is the name of a probability distribution, then R routinely offers four functions for mydist, distinguished by the first letter: dmydist(x, ...) the density function gives the probability (mass/density) \\(f(x)\\) for x pmydist(x, ...) the cumulative probability function gives the cumulative distribution function \\(F(x)\\) for x qmydist(p, ...) the quantile function gives the value \\(x\\) for which p = pmydist(x, ...) rmydist(n, ...) the random sample function returns n samples from the distribution For example, the family of functions for the normal distribution has the following functions: # density of standard normal at x = 1 dnorm(x = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1) ## [1] 0.2419707 # cumulative density of standard normal at q = 0 pnorm(q = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1) ## [1] 0.5 # point where the cumulative density of standard normal is p = 0 qnorm(p = 0.5, mean = 0, sd = 1) ## [1] 0 # n = 3 random samples from a standard normal rnorm(n = 3, mean = 0, sd = 1) ## [1] 0.06999783 2.53124310 0.50885834 "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
