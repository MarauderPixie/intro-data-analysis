### Nature, origin and rationale of the data

</div>

The politeness data is borrowed from [@WinterGrawunder2012:The-Phonetic-Pr].^[The politeness data is also discussed in two tutorial papers, namely by [@FrankeRoettger2019:Bayesian-regres] and by [@Winter2013:Linear-models-a].]
The data set contains measurements of voice pitch obtained from a $2 \times 2$ factorial design, with factors `gender` and `context`. 
The data is from Korean speakers.

Here is a glimpse of the data:

```{r}
politeness_data <- aida::data_polite
glimpse(politeness_data)
```

The variables contained here are:

- `subject`: an indicator for each experimental participant
- `gender`: an indicator of each participants gender (only binary)
- `sentence`: an indicator of the sentence spoken by the participant
- `context`: the main manipulation of whether the context was a "polite" or "informal" setting
- `pitch`: the measure voice pitch (presumably: average over the sentence spoken)

### Hypotheses

The main research question of interest here is whether voice pitch is higher in "polite" contexts than in "informal", and whether this effect is more or less present for male or female speakers.

### Summary statistics

Here are the mean pitch values for the four relevant design cells:

```{r, echo = F}
data_polite %>% 
  group_by(gender, context) %>% 
  summarize(mean_pitch = mean(pitch))
```


### Visualization

Here is a plot showing the distribution of pitch measures in each group (small semi-transparent points), as well the cell means (big solid points):

```{r, echo = F}
politedata <- politeness_data 
politedata.agg <- 
  politedata %>% 
    group_by(gender, context, sentence) %>% 
    summarize(mean_frequency = mean(pitch))

politedata.agg2 <- 
  politedata %>%
  group_by(gender, context) %>% 
  summarize(mean_frequency = round(mean(pitch), 0))

ggplot(data = politedata.agg, 
       aes(x = gender, 
           y = mean_frequency, 
           colour = context)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(0.5), 
             alpha = 0.3, 
             size = 3) +
  geom_point(data = politedata.agg2, 
             aes(x = gender, 
                 y = mean_frequency, 
                 #colour = context,
                 fill = context),
             position = position_dodge(0.5), 
             pch = 21, 
             colour = "black",
             size = 5) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c("F", "M"),
                  labels = c("female", "male")) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = (c(50,100,150,200,250,300)), limits = c(50,300)) +
  scale_colour_manual(breaks = c("inf", "pol"),
                      labels = c("informal", "polite"),
                      values = c("#f1a340", "#998ec3")) +
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c("inf", "pol"),
                      labels = c("informal", "polite"),
                      values = c("#f1a340", "#998ec3")) +
  ylab("pitch in Hz\n") +
  xlab("\ngender")
```

### Analysis

```{r}
# make predictors 'factors' so we can change contrast coding
data_polite <- aida::data_polite %>% 
  mutate(
    gender = factor(gender, levels = c('M', 'F')),
    context = factor(context, levels = c('pol', 'inf'))
  )
# apply 'sum' contrasts
contrasts(data_polite$context) <- contr.sum(2)
colnames(contrasts(data_polite$context)) <- ":polite"
contrasts(data_polite$gender) <- contr.sum(2)
colnames(contrasts(data_polite$gender)) <- ":male"

fit_brms_politeness_sum <- brm(
  pitch ~ gender * context,
  data_polite,
  iter = 4000
)
```


```{r}
summary(fit_brms_politeness_sum)$fixed[, c("l-95% CI", "Estimate" ,"u-95% CI")]
```

Intercept is the grand mean:

```{r}
grand_mean <- politeness_data %>% pull(pitch) %>% mean()
grand_mean
```

Slope "gender1" gives the deviation of the average pitch for category "female" from the grand mean, so that it intuitively encodes what is often called the "**main effect** of gender" (given that the deviation from the grand mean of the "male" category is just -1 times that for "female":

```{r}
mean_female <- politeness_data %>% filter(gender == "F") %>% pull(pitch) %>% mean()
main_eff_gender <- mean_female - grand_mean
main_eff_gender
```

Slope "context1" gives the deviation of the average pitch for category "polite" from the grand mean, so that it intuitively captures the "main effect of context":

```{r}
mean_informal <- politeness_data %>% filter(context == "inf") %>% pull(pitch) %>% mean()
main_eff_context <- mean_informal - grand_mean
main_eff_context
```

The interaction term "gender1:context1" specifies how much the mean of the design cell "female-polite" deviates from the predictions based on only main effects:

```{r}
mean_informal_female <- politeness_data %>% 
  filter(context == "inf", gender == "F") %>% 
  pull(pitch) %>% mean()
mean_informal_female -(grand_mean + main_eff_gender + main_eff_context)
```

### ANOVA

```{r}
aov(pitch ~ gender * context, politeness_data) %>% summary()
```
