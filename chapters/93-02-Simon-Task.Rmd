The [Simon task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_effect) is a well-established experimental paradigm designed to study how different properties of a stimulus might interfere during information processing or decision making.
Concretely, the original Simon investigates if responses are faster and more accurate when the stimulus to respond to occurs in the same relative location (e.g., right on the screen) as the response button required by that stimulus (e.g., pressing the button `p` on the keyboard). 

### Experiment

You can try out the experiment for yourself [here](https://icnp-exp3.netlify.app/).

#### Participants 

A total of `r d$submission_id %>% unique %>% length` participants took part in an online version of a Simon task. 
Participants were students of Cognitive Science at the University of OsnabrÃ¼ck, taking part in courses "Introduction to Cognitive (Neuro-)Psychology" or "Experimental Psychology Lab Practice" in the summer term of 2019.

#### Materials & Design

Each trial started by showing a fixation cross for 200 ms in the center of the screen. Then, one of two geometrical shapes was shown for 500 ms. The **target shape** was either a blue square or a blue circle. The target shape appeared either on the left or right of the screen. Each trial determined uniformly at random which shape (square or circle) to show as target and where on the screen to display it (left or right). Participants were instructed to press keys `q` (left of keyboard) or `p` (right of keyboard) to identify the kind of shape on the screen. The shape-key allocation happened experiment initially, uniformly at random once for each participant and remained constant throughout the experiment. For example, a participant may have been asked to press `q` for square and `p` for circle.

Trials were categorized as either 'congruent' or 'incongruent'. They were congruent if the location of the stimulus was the same relative location as the response key (e.g., square on the right of the screen, and `p` key to be pressed for square) and incongruent if the stimulus was not in the same relative location as the response key (e.g., square on the right and `q` key to be pressed for square).

In each trial, if no key was pressed within 3 seconds after the appearance of the target shape, a message to please respond faster was displayed on the screen.

#### Procedure

Participants were first welcomed and made familiar with the experiment. They were told to optimize both speed and accuracy. They then practiced the task for 20 trials before starting the main task, which consisted of 100 trials. Finally, the experiment ended with a post-test survey in which participants were asked for their student IDs and the class they were enrolled in. They were also able to leave any optional comments.

### Hypotheses

We are interested in the following hypotheses:

#### Hypothesis 1: Reaction times

If stimulus location interferes with information processing, we expect that it should take longer to make correct responses in the incongruent condition than in the congruent condition. Schematically, our first hypothesis about decision speed is therefore:

$$
\text{RT}_{\text{correct},\ \text{congruent}} > \text{RT}_{\text{correct},\ \text{incongruent}}
$$

#### Hypothesis 2: Accuracy

If stimulus location interferes with information processing, we also expect to see more errors in the incongruent condition than in the congruent condition.
Schematically, our second hypothesis about decision accuracy is therefore:

$$
\text{RT}_{\text{correct},\ \text{congruent}} > \text{RT}_{\text{correct},\ \text{incongruent}}
$$

### Results

#### Loading and inspecting the data

We load the data into R and show a summary of the variables stored in the tibble:

```{r}
d <- read_csv("data_sets/simon-task.csv")
glimpse(d)
```

The most important columns in this data set for our purposes are:

- `submission_id`: An ID identifying each participant.
- `RT`: The reaction time for each trial.
- `condition`: Whether the trial was a congruent or an incongruent trial.
- `correctness`: Whether the answer on the current trial was correct or incorrect.
- `trial_type`: Whether the data is from a practice or a main test trial.

#### Cleaning the data

We look at outlier-y behavior at the level of individual participants first, then at the level of individual trials.

##### Individual-level error rates & reaction times

It is conceivable that some participants did not take the task seriously. They may have just fooled around. We will therefore inspect each individual's response patterns and reaction times. If participants appear to have "misbehaved", we discard all of their data. (**CAVEAT:** Notice the researcher degrees of freedom in the decision of what counts as "misbehavior"! It is therefore that choices like these are best committed to in advance, e.g., via pre-registration!)

We can calculate the mean reaction times and the error rates for each participant.

```{r}
d_individual_summary <- d %>% 
  filter(trial_type == "main") %>%    # look at only data from main trials
  group_by(submission_id) %>%         # calculate the following for each individual
  summarize(mean_RT = mean(RT),
            error_rate = 1 - mean(ifelse(correctness == "correct", 1, 0)))
head(d_individual_summary)
```

Let's plot this summary information:

```{r}
d_individual_summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_RT, y = error_rate)) +
  geom_point()
```

Here's a crude way of branding outlier-participants:

```{r}
d_individual_summary <- d_individual_summary %>% 
  mutate(outlier = case_when(mean_RT < 350 ~ TRUE,
                             mean_RT > 750 ~ TRUE,
                             error_rate > 0.5 ~ TRUE,
                             TRUE ~ FALSE))
d_individual_summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_RT, y = error_rate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = filter(d_individual_summary, outlier == TRUE),
             color = "firebrick", shape = "square", size = 5)

```

We then clean the data set in a first step by removing all participants identified as outlier-y:

```{r, message=TRUE}
d <- full_join(d, d_individual_summary, by = "submission_id") # merge the tibbles
d <- filter(d, outlier == FALSE)
message("We excluded ", sum(d_individual_summary$outlier) , " participants for suspicious mean RTs and higher error rates.")
```


##### Trial-level reaction times

It is also conceivable that inidividual trials resulted in early accidental key presses or were interrupted in some way or another. We therefore look at the overall distribution of RTs and determine what to exclude. (Again, it is important that decisions of what to exclude should ideally be publicly preregistered before data analysis.)

Let's first plot the overall distribution of RTs. 

```{r}
d %>% ggplot(aes(x = RT)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = RT, y = 1), alpha = 0.3, height = 300)
```

Some very long RTs make this graph rather uninformative.
Let's therefore exclude all trials that lasted longer than 1 second and also all trials with reaction times under 100 ms.

```{r}
message(
  "We exclude ",
  nrow(filter(d, RT < 100)) + nrow(filter(d, RT > 1000)),
  " trials based on too fast or too slow RTs."
)
# exclude these trials
d <- filter(d, RT > 100 & RT < 1000)
```

Here's the distribution of RTs after cleaning:

```{r}
d %>% ggplot(aes(x = RT)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = RT, y = 1), alpha = 0.3, height = 300)
```


We save the cleaned data for future reuse, discarding the training trials:

```{r, eval = F}
d <- filter(d, trial_type == "main")
write_csv(d, "data_sets/simon-task_cleaned.csv")
```

#### Hypothesis-driven summary statistics

##### Hypothesis 1: Reaction times

We are mostly interested in the influence of congruency on the reaction times in the trials where participants gave a correct answer. But here we also look at, for comparison, the reaction times for the incongruent trials.

Here is a summary of the means and standard deviations for each condition:

```{r}
d_sum <- d %>% 
  group_by(correctness, condition) %>% 
  summarize(mean_RT = mean(RT),
            sd_RT = sd(RT))
d_sum
```


Numerically, the reaction times for the corrent-congruent trials are indeed faster than for the correct-incongruent trials.

Here's a plot of the reaction times split up by whether the answer was correct and whether the trial was congruent or incongruent. 

```{r}
d %>% ggplot(aes(x = RT)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(y = 0.0005), alpha = 0.1, height = 0.0005) +
  geom_density(fill = "gray", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(data = d_sum, 
             mapping = aes(xintercept = mean_RT), 
             color = "firebrick") +
  facet_grid(condition ~ correctness)
```


##### Hypothesis 2: Accuracy

Our second hypothesis is about the proportion of correct answers, comparing the congruent against the incongruent trials.
Here is a summary statistic for the acurracy in both conditions:

```{r}
d %>% group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarize(acurracy = mean(correctness == "correct"))
```

Again, numerically it seems that the hypothesis is borne out that accuracy is higher in the congruent trials.

### Statistical analysis

#### Hypothesis 1: Reaction times

We are interested in comparing the RTs of correct answers in the congruent and incongruent conditions. 
We saw a difference in mean reaction times, but we'd like to know if this difference is meaningful. 
One way of testing this is by running a regression model, which tries to predict RTs as a function of congruency. 
We include by-participant random slopes and random intercepts, thereby allowing for the plausible idea that some participants might be faster than others irrespective of the condition, and that some participants' RTs might be influenced more by the experimental manipulation (congruent vs incongruent) than others.

```{r, eval = F}
model_ST = brm(RT ~ condition + (1 + condition | submission_id), filter(d, correctness == "correct"))
```

```{r echo = F}
model_ST <- readRDS("models_brms/simon-task-RT.rds")
```


A full summary of this model looks like this:

```{r Simon-Task-Model}
summary(model_ST)
```


We are, however, most interested in the coefficient coding the difference between conditions.
Here's an exctracted summary for the posterior of this parameter:

```{r}
posterior_samples(model_ST)$b_conditionincongruent %>% aida::summarize_sample_vector()
```

According to this analysis, there is reason to believe in a difference in RTs between congruent and incongruent groups. The coefficient estimated for the incongruent group is on average ca. `r posterior_samples(model_ST)$conditionincongruent %>% mean() %>% round(2)` ms higher than that of the congruent group.
The 95% credible interval around this estimate clearly excludes zero.

We can use the encompassing model approach to calculate a Bayes factor in favor of the directed hypothesis 1, compared against its logical negation.
Notice that the prior assumed for the relevant coefficient is symmetric, so that we do not have to correct for the _a priori_ probability of hypotheses.

```{r}
# test the directed hypothesis
post_samples_delta <- posterior_samples(model_ST)$b_conditionincongruent
sum(post_samples_delta > 0) / sum(post_samples_delta <= 0)
```

The Bayes factor in favor of the directed hypothesis 1 over its logial negation is `r sum(post_samples_delta > 0) / sum(post_samples_delta <= 0) %>% round(2)`, which is clear evidence for the idea that reaction times are slowed by incongruency of stimulus location and response button location.

#### [Excursion:] Further exploration: Comparing RTs across the diagonal

We can also look at the interaction between correctness and condition.
As shown in the above graph, there are four different cells in a 2x2 grid.

In the model below, this is coded with 'dummy coding' such that the top-left cell (congruent-correct) is the intercept, and each other cell is calculated by the addition of offsets.
We omit random effects here to speed up sampling.

```{r, eval = F}
model_ST_complex <- brm(RT ~ condition * correctness, d)
```

We may want to ask the question: are reaction times to correct-congruent responses shorter than reaction times to incorrect-incongruent responses?

To do this, we first need to extract the posterior samples from our model.

```{r, eval = F}
post_samples <- posterior_samples(model_ST_complex) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Then we need to determine the correct offsets to match the correct-congruent and incorrect-incongruent cells in the design matrix.

```{r, eval = F}

# correct-congruent is the reference cell
correct_congruent <- post_samples$b_Intercept

# incorrect_incongruent is the bottom-right cell
incorrect_incongruent <- post_samples$b_Intercept +
  post_samples$b_conditionincongruent + 
  post_samples$b_correctnessincorrect + 
  post_samples$`b_conditionincongruent:correctnessincorrect`
```

Once we know these, we can calculate the probability that the comparison is in the correct direction.
 
```{r, eval = F}
mean(correct_congruent < incorrect_incongruent)
```


#### Hypothesis 2: Acurracy

We test acurracy with a logistic regression:

```{r}
# TBD
```
