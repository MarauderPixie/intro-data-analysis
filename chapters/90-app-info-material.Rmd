## Further information on WebPPL

WebPPL (pronounced "web people") is a probabilistic programming language embedded in JavaScript. Unlike JavaScript, WebPPL does not support
looping constructs (such as `for` or `while`). Instead, it encourages a functional way of programming, using recursion and higher-order functions. Please refer to this [tutorial](http://www.problang.org/chapters/app-06-intro-to-webppl.html) for examples and further explanations.

### Primitives and sampling functions

We can use WebPPL to (easily) sample from probability distributions, many of which are already implemented and ready to use. A full list of built-in primitive distributions can be found in the [documentation](https://webppl.readthedocs.io/en/master/distributions.html#primitives). If we would like to draw one sample from, say, a standard normal distribution, we could run `sample(Gaussian({mu: 0, sigma: 1}))`. A more convenient expression would be to just use the respective sampling function, in this case `gaussian({mu: 0, sigma: 1})` (notice the lowercase letter in the function name). Sampling functions can be combined with the `repeat()` function to take more than one sample, ultimately leading to better approximations. 

Let's look at a simple example to see how repeated sampling from a primitive distribution works. In the code box below, we take $1000$ samples from a [beta distribution](#app-91-distributions-beta) with parameters $\alpha = 4$ and $\beta = 6$ and visualize them (more on this below).

<pre class="webppl">
viz(repeat(1000, function() {beta({a: 4, b: 6})}));
</pre>

<pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation">
</pre>


<script>
// find all <pre> elements and set up the editor on them
var preEls = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.getElementsByClassName("webppl"));
preEls.map(function(el) { console.log(el); editor.setup(el, {language: 'webppl'}); });
</script> 


### Inference with `Infer()`

We might also want to create our own distribution objects (= probability distributions). For this purpose, the built-in function `Infer()` comes in pretty handy. It takes as input a function with no arguments and returns a distribution object. The function passed to `Infer()` is the sampling function that should be turned into a distribution object. Additionally, `Infer()` can take on another optional argument, namely the *method* for performing inference. If this argument is not specified, WebPPL will automatically choose a reasonable method for inference. More on this function and different methods [here](https://webppl.readthedocs.io/en/master/inference/index.html).

Here's an example of how to perform inference using the MCMC method. Click on the yellowish box to check what the code does and how `Infer()` is used. Please re-visit Chapter \@ref(ch-03-03-MCMC) for more information on MCMC algorithms.

<pre class="webppl">
// data to explain
var xs = [-10, -5, 2, 6, 10];
var labels = [false, false, true, true, true];
///fold:
var model = function() {
  var m = gaussian(0, 1);
  var b = gaussian(0, 1);
  var sigma = gamma(1, 1);

  var y = function(x) {
    return gaussian(m * x + b, sigma);
  };
  var sigmoid = function(x) {
    return 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-1 * y(x)));
  };

  map2(
    function(x, label) {
      factor(Bernoulli({p: sigmoid(x)}).score(label));
    },
    xs,
    labels);

  return sigmoid(8);
};

viz.auto(Infer({method: 'MCMC', samples: 10000, burn: 2000}, model));
///
</pre>

<pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation">
</pre>


<script>
// find all <pre> elements and set up the editor on them
var preEls = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.getElementsByClassName("webppl"));
preEls.map(function(el) { console.log(el); editor.setup(el, {language: 'webppl'}); });
</script> 

### Visualization

WebPPL comes with a major benefit in that it makes plotting as easy as pie. All we have to do is basically wrap the `viz()` function of the `viz`-package around our data, and depending on the nature of the data (continuous or discrete), WebPPL will automatically come up with a visualization of it. Of course, we can also explicitly tell WebPPL how we want our data to be plotted. Much like in `ggplot`, we just add the (abbreviated) plotting method to the function name. An explicit way of plotting a histogram, for instance, would be to call `viz.hist()`. The supported methods for data visualization are documented [here](https://github.com/probmods/webppl-viz). 

In the example below, the data stored in variable `xs` is plotted once with the default `viz()` function and once with the explicit `viz.hist()` function. What do you notice with regard to the output?

<pre class="webppl">
var xs = [-2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]; 

viz(xs);
viz.hist(xs);
</pre>

<pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation">
</pre>


<script>
// find all <pre> elements and set up the editor on them
var preEls = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.getElementsByClassName("webppl"));
preEls.map(function(el) { console.log(el); editor.setup(el, {language: 'webppl'}); });
</script> 


### Installation

You can run WebPPL code directly from within the editor on [webppl.org](http://webppl.org/). If you want to install WebPPL locally, follow the steps below:

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. Run `npm install -g webppl` in your command line.

Run `npm update -g webppl` to update your current version of WebPPL.

These steps are also mentioned in the [documentation](https://webppl.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html).

### Usage

Run WebPPL programs locally with `webppl FILE_NAME.wppl`.

### Keyboard shortcuts (for in-browser use)

- Press `Ctrl` + `Enter` to run code.
- Select code and press the `Tab` key to fix indentations.
- Press `Ctrl` + `/` to comment or uncomment code (apparently, this shortcut only works with an English keyboard).
