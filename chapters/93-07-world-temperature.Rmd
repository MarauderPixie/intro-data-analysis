This data set has been downloaded from [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/).^[Downloaded on October 6th 2020.] More information on the origin and composition of this data set can be found on [here](http://berkeleyearth.org/data-new/). Specifically, what we will use here is the time series data for "land only" using the annual summary of monthly average temperature. We have added to the data set used here the absolute average temperature. (Berkeley Earth only lists the "annual anomaly", i.e., the deviation from a grand mean.) 

Columns of interest are:

+ `year` - year of the observation (1750-2019)
+ `anomaly` - deviation from the grand mean of 1750-1980, which equals 8.61 degrees Celcius
+ `uncertainty` - measure of uncertainty associated with the reported `anomaly`
+ `avg_temp` - the annual average world surface temperature

### Loading and preprocessing the data

We load the data into a variable named `data_temperature`:

```{r, echo = F}
data_temperature <- read_csv('data_sets/average-world-temperature.csv')
```

```{r, eval = F}
avocado_data <- read_csv(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-franke/intro-data-analysis/master/data_sets/average-world-temperature.csv')) %>% 
  # remove currently irrelevant columns
  select( -X1 , - contains("Bags"), - year, - region) %>% 
  # rename variables of interest for convenience
  rename(
    total_volume_sold = `Total Volume`,
    average_price = `AveragePrice`,
    small  = '4046',
    medium = '4225',
    large  = '4770',
  )
```
