This is a very short and non-serious experiment that asks for just three binary decisions from each participant, namely their spontaneous preference for one of two presented options (biology vs logic, jazz vs metal and mountains vs beach). The data from this experiment will be analyzed and plotted. This is supposed to be a useful and hopefully entertaining self-generated data set with which to practice making contingency tables and to apply binomial tests and fun stuff like that.


#### The experiment

##### Participants

We obtained data from 102 particpants of this very course. 

##### Material 

There were three critical trials (and nothing else). All trials had the same trailing question:

> If you have to choose between the following two options, which one do you prefer?

Each critical trial then presented two options as buttons, one of which had to be clicked. 

1. Biology vs Logic
2. Jazz vs Metal
3. Mountains vs Beach

##### Procedure

Each participant saw all three critical trials (and no other trials) in random order.

##### Realization

The experiment was realized using [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html) and can be tried out [here](https://magpie-bio-logical-jazz-metal.netlify.com).

#### Theoretical motivation & hypotheses

This is a bogus experiment, and no sane person would advance a serious hypothesis about this. Except that, actually, the lecturer is careless enough to conjecture that appreciators of Metal music like logic more than Jazz-enthusiasts would (because Metal is cleaner and more mechanic, while Jazz is fuzzy and organic, obviously).^[Notice how easy it is to motivate any-old psychological theory. Some other scientific disciplines are much better at smothering nonsensical ideas from the start.]

### Loading and preprocessing the data

First, load the data:

```{r, echo = F}
data_BLJM_raw <- read_csv('data_sets/bio-logic-jazz-metal-data-raw.csv',
                          col_types = cols(
                            submission_id = col_double(),
                            QUD = col_logical(),
                            RT = col_double(),
                            age = col_double(),
                            comments = col_character(),
                            education = col_character(),
                            endTime = col_double(),
                            experiment_id = col_double(),
                            gender = col_character(),
                            languages = col_character(),
                            option1 = col_character(),
                            option2 = col_character(),
                            question = col_character(),
                            response = col_character(),
                            startDate = col_character(),
                            startTime = col_double(),
                            timeSpent = col_double(),
                            trial_name = col_character(),
                            trial_number = col_double()
                          ))
glimpse(data_BLJM_raw)
```

```{r, eval = F}
data_BLJM_raw <- read_csv(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-franke/intro-data-analysis/master/data_sets/bio-logic-jazz-metal-data-raw.csv'))
```


Take a peak:

```{r}
glimpse(data_BLJM_raw)
```


The most important variables in this data set are:

- `submission_id`: unique identifier for each participant
- `option1` and `option2`: what the choice options where
- `response`: which of the two options was chosen

Notice that there is no convenient column indicating which of the three critical conditions we are dealing with, so we create that information from the information in columns `option1` and `option2`, while also discarding everything we will not need:

```{r}
data_BLJM_processed <- 
  data_BLJM_raw %>% 
  mutate(
    condition = str_c(str_sub(option2,1, 1), str_sub(option1,1, 1))
  ) %>% 
  select(submission_id, condition, response)
# write_csv(data_BLJM_processed, "../data_sets/bio-logic-jazz-metal-data-processed.csv")
data_BLJM_processed
```

### Exploration: counts & plots

We are interest in some counts. First, let's look at the overal choice rates in each condition:

```{r}
data_BLJM_processed %>% 
  # function`count` is masked by another package, must call explicitly
  dplyr::count(condition, response)
```

Overall it seems that mountains are preferred over beaches, Jazz is preferred over Metal and Biology is preferred over Logic.

The overall counts, however, do not tell us anything about any potentially interesting relationship between preferences. So, let's have a closer look at the lecturer's conjecture that a preference for logic tends to go with a stronger preference for metal than a preference for biology does. To check this, we need to look at different counts, namely the number of people who selected which music-subject pair. We collect these counts in variable `BLJM_associated_counts`:

```{r}
BLJM_associated_counts <- data_BLJM_processed %>% 
  select(submission_id, condition, response) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = condition, values_from = response) %>% 
  select(-BM) %>% 
  dplyr::count(JM,LB) 
BLJM_associated_counts
```

Notice that this representation is tidy, but not as ideal for visual inspection. A more commonly seen format can be obtained by pivoting to a wider representation:

```{r}
# visually attractive table representation
BLJM_associated_counts %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = LB, values_from = n)
```

The tidy representation *is* ideal for plotting, though. Notice, however, that the code below plots proportions of choices, not raw counts:

```{r}
BLJM_associated_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = LB, y = n/sum(n), color = JM, shape = JM, group = JM)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) + geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of choices of each music+subject pair",
    x = "",
    y = ""
  )
```

The lecturer's conjecture might be correct. This does look like there could be an interaction. While Jazz is preferred more generally, the preference for Jazz over Metal seems more pronounced for those participants who preferred Biology than for those who preferred Logic.
